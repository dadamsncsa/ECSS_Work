Iran has a fake aircraft carrier that it uses for target practice as it trains to take on the US Navy, which routinely puts flattops and other surface vessels in the Persian Gulf and surrounding waterways. Iran severely damaged its replica of a US Navy Nimitz-class carrier during drills in 2015, and the ship, a painted barge designed to look like a carrier, sat like that for years. Recent satellite photos taken by Planet Labs and first reported by Defense One show that Iran has completed or is close to completing repair work, meaning it may be preparing to start bombing the fake ship again.

The vessel sat damaged for years, but it appears to be back in action, meaning it's time for the country's armed forces to start trying to sink it again. Satellite images provided to Insider by Planet Labs and first reported by Defense One show that Iran appears to have completed or be close to completing repairs on its mock flattop, a painted barge resembling a US Navy Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, after damaging it during target practice in 2015. Photo courtesy of Planet Labs Inc. Iran first started constructing a mock-up of a US aircraft carrier in 2014, CNN reported at the time, citing satellite photos of the work being done at the port of Bandar Abbas. The purpose of the carrier construction project was not immediately clear. Following the CNN report, Rear Adm. Ali Fadavi, who was then commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps naval forces, revealed the point of the replica carrier. \"We have been making and sinking replicas of US destroyers, frigates, and warships for long years,\" he told Iranian media. \"We practice the same drills on replica aircraft carriers because sinking and destroying US warships has, is, and will be on our agenda.\" In February the following year, Iran announced that it had destroyed a mock aircraft carrier during the Payambar-e Azam 9 (The Great Prophet 9) war games in the Persian Gulf, where US carriers have routinely sailed for years in shows of force. Iranian media said that the ship was destroyed by rockets fired from \"tens of IRGC speedboats.\" The fake flattop was also struck by IRGC cruise and ballistic missiles, the report said. US Navy video by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Brian M. Wilbur The mock carrier was not actually destroyed, but it was damaged. It remained in such a state for years until Iran began actively working to repair it last fall amid heightened tensions with the US, which had deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln and thousands of additional troops to the US Central Command area of responsibility to confront Iran. In October, one month before construction began, Defense One reported Brig. Gen. Amirali Hajizadeh, the head of Iran's IRGC Aerospace Force, threatened US bases and carriers. \"Everybody should know that all American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers around Iran are within the range of our missiles,\" he said. Hajizadeh's forces were recently involved in a missile strike on US and coalition forces in Iraq in the wake of a US drone strike the killed Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Bryan Clark, a defense expert and former US Navy officer, told Defense One that the mock-up could be used for major exercises in the spring, adding that Iran could use the fake flattop for cruise-missile strikes, small-boat attacks, and drone strikes.

    "[] PHOENIX — For Molly Nygren, longtime Democrat and Houston transplant, 2018 was her first election in Arizona. Alice Lehr skipped the 2016 presidential election, but believes politics reached an intolerable tipping point last year under President Donald Trump. Both women participated in the state’s historic 2018 election, in which Democrats won a U.S. Senate race in Arizona for the first time in 30 years and won three other statewide contests. They are the type of voters who will help settle Arizona’s elections in a year when Democrats and Republicans alike are treating the state as a crucial battleground for the White House and control of the Senate in November. Nygren, a Gilbert nurse, lives in the southeast Valley, where Democrat Kyrsten Sinema persuaded voters who collectively supported Trump in 2016 to back her Senate bid in 2018. “I wasn’t working, and didn’t know what to do with myself,” Nygren, 41, said of her political engagement in her new home state. “I kind of thrust myself into politics when I moved here.” Lehr lives in a new home in Buckeye, near where Democrats have traditionally done well, but where turnout is relatively light. Unimpressed with her choices, she didn’t vote in the presidential race in 2016, but chose Sinema over Republican Martha McSally in 2018. In 2018, voters like Lehr, 74, turned out in record numbers. The bulging margins in those areas helped negate McSally’s strong showing in rural Arizona. An Arizona Republic analysis of precinct-level voting results and registration trends shows both parties making gains, but Democrats turned Republican red precincts purple, while their blue precincts turned deeper blue. An area that roughly traces Loop 101, from communities spanning the Gilbert-Chandler line up north through Scottsdale, west to Peoria, has emerged as a key battleground within a state where the outcome will be fiercely fought. These voters were most likely to split their tickets in 2018 and could do so again this year. Arizona’s changing election results owe partly to evolving demographics and to the unique moment in its politics. The state is, as usual, one of the fastest-growing in the nation, and its Hispanic population is increasingly of age to vote. At the same time, Trump, the most polarizing figure in politics, has helped push up GOP support among whites and in rural areas, while pushing away college-educated voters and minorities. With Trump back on the ballot this year, Democrats think they can build on their winning formula from 2018. Republicans are hopeful their party can again carry a state Trump won by 3.5 percentage points in 2016. Both parties will be battling for voters like Jeff Blodgett, a Republican from Peoria, just off Loop 101. He's a disaffected Republican who voted for Trump and McSally in past elections but is open to voting for Democrats in the presidential and Senate races this year. He's fed up with the partisan fighting that has gridlocked the nation. So, too, were most of the two dozen Arizona voters interviewed in key precincts. \"They don't want to work together,\" Blodgett, 62, said. \"It's like a war.\" At a recent appearance at the Arizona Republican Party’s headquarters in central Phoenix, Trump’s campaign manager Brad Parscale was preparing his troops. Parscale stood before a room filled with supporters to give them the inside scoop on the “biggest volunteer army in the history of the Republican Party” that he was building to help Trump in 2020. For Republicans, alarm bells are ringing. Trump's narrow win in 2016 and the party's 2018 loss of a Senate seat signaled peril. Republicans view the state as one of the most competitive in the election cycle and began building out their 2020 political infrastructure months earlier than normal. Vice President Mike Pence said during his October visit to the state that he and Trump would spend a lot of time in Arizona this election season. Republicans expect Trump could visit the state early this year. “You’ve got to understand,” Parscale said to supporters. “Arizona has not normally been a state where we’ve had to put this much work into it. Democrats see Arizona as a possibility. I don’t think it’s there yet, but that’s why all of you have to make sure you get active and you work hard.” Republicans are having to work harder because the state is in flux, political experts say. “In some ways, this is like the proverbial frog in the boiling water. These changes are happening, but they’re happening so slowly, it’s hard for us to observe them,” said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political science professor who studies voting behavior. “You’ve got a competitive Senate election, you’ve got a competitive presidential election, and these changes are going to manifest themselves statewide, but at the same time they’re going to be geographically located” in the suburbs, he said. McDonald said Arizona’s newfound competitiveness is a combination of an electorate growing more ethnically diverse, which usually benefits Democrats, while it also becomes older, which typically helps Republicans. Rachel Bitecofer, an election forecaster at Virginia’s Christopher Newport University, sees Arizona continuing its leftward lean in 2020. “When I’m looking at Arizona, I’m looking at the metro areas … and how much untapped surge potential is there,” she said. “They have not tapped into anywhere near the potential of the Latino population. If the Democrats were running Republican campaign efficiency, Arizona would already be blue. The voters are already there.” Midterm elections typically see a sharp fall in participation. This is usually most evident in more diverse areas. But in 2018, Arizona’s Hispanic voters remained politically engaged, according to a voting analysis by Catalist, a progressive firm that tracks voter data. The estimated share of Hispanics in the midterms fell by 0.2 percentage points or less in 16 of the state’s 30 legislative districts, the firm's data shows. In three contiguous districts running diagonally from Litchfield Park, east to Paradise Valley, the Hispanic share of voters actually went up. Their sustained presence was seen in districts with large Hispanic populations and in ones where they are a small fraction of the electorate. And there are Hispanics who plan to vote this year who haven't before. In 2016, Democrat Norma Hernandez was so uninspired with her choices for president, she didn’t vote. She won’t do that again in November. “I want him out,” the middle-aged mom said of Trump. “I feel like he’s not really working for the people. He’s working for himself. I want to have a voice. If there’s going to be change, I want to be a part of it.” Hernandez plans on voting for whomever the Democrats nominate. She also plans on voting for Democratic candidate Mark Kelly in the Senate race. Whether it was driven by Trump’s border and immigration policies or just a growing political engagement already seen in other states, such as Florida, Hispanic voters had a bigger stake in the results in 2018. That trend is expected to carry over into the 2020 elections. While Hispanics figured more prominently in the state’s electoral equation in 2018, so, too, did the state’s two population centers, Phoenix and Tucson. In 2014, turnout in Arizona’s two most populous counties, Maricopa and Pima, was about 1 percentage point lower than it was in the 13 other counties. In 2018, turnout in Maricopa and Pima was 3 percentage points higher than the rest of the state. It has meant a growing share of voters — 77% in 2016 and 2018 — came from areas that are more urban and racially diverse. There is another troubling fault line for Republicans in Pima County. Trump lost in that historically Democratic-leaning county by 57,000 votes. He mostly erased that deficit by winning Maricopa County by 44,000 votes and carried the rest of the state by 104,000. In 2018, McSally won rural Arizona by 65,000 votes. But she lost by 60,000 in Maricopa County and by 61,000 in Pima County. The Pima results were especially disappointing for a candidate from Tucson. Her problem in Pima County could get worse running against the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who hailed from southeastern Arizona. Trump carried Arizona in 2016, but McSally's performance in 2018 suggests a need for Republicans to expand well past the rural voters who have been a reliable cornerstone of their political base. Both parties are working on the ground to identify new voters they believe will help them get the upper hand in a narrowly divided state. For Republicans, one Trump-aligned PAC has identified 142,000 prospects they deem as conservatives who have not already voted for Trump but likely would. Groups aligned with Democrats are targeting a pool of 200,000 new registrants. The changing mix of people who vote in Arizona contributes to the state’s partisan drift. Arizona remains one of the fastest-growing states in the country, and Maricopa County has been the nation’s fastest-growing county three years in a row. Figures from the U.S. Census Bureau suggest the county’s new residents largely come from Democratic-leaning areas. Twelve of the 15 out-of-state counties that have provided the most new residents to Maricopa County in recent years are locations where Democrats have dominated elections or voter registration. These include Democratic counties encompassing areas such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Houston and Chicago. But the transplants come in all political stripes. Republican Scott Fishman, 53, moved to Goodyear three years ago from New Jersey, drawn by the nice weather and lower taxes. He plans on voting for Trump again in 2020, even though he views him — and all other politicians — as “corrupt.” Fishman said Trump’s America First agenda is a patriotic appeal to people like him, who feel like the nation has been ripped off by international trade deals. “I’m us-first,” he said. “We put everybody first all the time. You can’t do that. You’ve got to put us first.” He sees the Democratic candidates as too weak to go toe-to-toe with Trump on the issues that matter most to him, such as border security and job creation. “I like (Trump’s) personality. He’s not boring,\" Fishman said. \"Is he the most articulate? No, but then again you’ve got (former Vice President Joe) Biden, who is articulate, but can’t put two sentences together without jumbling it up. And with them, everyone’s far left. Everything is free.” Perhaps no part of Maricopa County better epitomizes the changing complexion of the state’s most populous region than the area around Chandler and Gilbert. The cities, home to corporate anchors such as Intel, GoDaddy and Northrop Grumman, have had some of the largest population gains in the nation’s fastest-growing county. Census data shows residents are, as usual, relatively well-educated and affluent. But the political winds have shifted. While many areas of the county voted less Republican than in recent years, this area of the southeast Valley flipped outright from 2014 to 2018. Voters in those cities supported Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2014 and Republican Sen. John McCain in 2016. But they supported Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race, and Sinema in last year’s Senate race. Thad Letnes, 41, is one of them. The Chandler software engineer is an independent who split his 2016 ballot to vote for Clinton and McCain, who was elected to his sixth term. Troubled by Trump’s attitudes toward science, the media and abortion rights, Letnes finds himself more aligned with Democrats these days. He voted for Sinema over McSally and plans to vote against McSally again in 2020. He’s not yet impressed with any of the Democratic presidential candidates, but he plans to vote against Trump. “I’m worried that we’re going to continue all the craziness,” Letnes said, sitting on a park bench in Chandler. Across the street, Toyosi Omojaro said Democrats may force her to vote for Trump. Omojaro is a physician who moved to Chandler from Virginia last year and is a longtime Republican, although she hasn’t voted for a president since George W. Bush in 2004. The middle-aged mom is so turned off by the partisan “chaos” that she registered in Arizona as an independent voter. “I didn’t want a label this time around,” Omojaro said. “I wanted to go in with a free mind.” She appreciates Trump’s anti-abortion stances and his rejection of political correctness. But she’s turned off by his profanity-laced tirades and his treatment of women. “I do applaud some of the things he does, but the way he goes about it just rubs me the wrong way,” Omojaro said. “I would want to be able to turn on the TV and let my daughter listen to a news conference without all this vulgarity. It’s not necessary.” She’s open to voting for a Democrat, but it must be someone more moderate than Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. If Democrats veer too far left, “I may close my eyes,” and vote for Trump, she said. She hasn’t paid attention to her new state’s Senate race, and was unfamiliar with McSally or Kelly, the Democratic contender. One thing that isn’t changing in Arizona is whom GOP voters want. Bitecofer, the professor of political science, dismissed the idea that Republican voters abandoned their party in 2018. “This idea that Republicans were disaffected is wrong. There’s no evidence that Republicans were embarrassed or sad because they showed up in big numbers in 2018,” she said. “There was no additional crossover voting. It’s not that these House districts flipped because of Republicans joining hands with Democrats.” Bitecofer said Sinema, who won by 2.3 percentage points, received at most up to 2 percentage points of Republican voters more than what happens in any election. Beyond that, Arizona voters just included more people who voted for Democrats, she said. To get a sense of where Arizona may be heading, keep an eye on Texas, she said. “If Texas is within reach, Arizona basically becomes locked in,” Bitecofer said. “If there’s a Latino somewhere on the ticket, I just can’t see how Arizona can’t go Democratic.” Reach the reporters at ronald.hansen@arizonarepublic.com, yvonne.wingett@arizonarepublic.com and pamela.larson@azcentral.com.

    "[]  A dishonorably discharged US Marine was charged with impersonating a law enforcement officer and accused of entering a protective zone around a private terminal used for President Donald Trump's flights into Florida, according to court documents. Thirty seven-year-old Brandon Magnan of Florida told sheriff's deputies he was a Marine Corps law enforcement officer and presented a fake badge that included the Marine Corps' seal. Magnan was allowed through the first checkpoint and drove towards a second one, where he was also permitted to continue after claiming he was a Marine law enforcement officer. After he made it inside a protective zone, Magnan, who was not in a Marine Corps uniform \"as in common practice during active presidential travel,\" was approached by Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office deputy, a Secret Service agent said in court documents. Magnan posted a $100,000 bond with the help of his mother and was released on Monday. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. A dishonorably discharged US Marine was charged with impersonating a law enforcement officer and accused of entering a protective zone around a private terminal used for President Donald Trump's flights in Florida, according to court documents. At around 3:00 p.m. local time on Sunday, 37-year-old Brandon Magnan of Florida and another unidentified male drove a maroon Honda Pilot towards a designated \"protective zone\" used for Trump's travels from West Palm Beach, Florida, to Washington, DC. Speaking to the deputies at the first roadblock, Magnan claimed he was a Marine Corps law enforcement officer and presented a fake badge that included the Marine Corps' seal. Marine Corps pilots, ground crew, and military police are typically used for Trump's short, helicopter trips using Marine One. Magnan was allowed through the first checkpoint and drove towards a second one, where he was also permitted to continue after claiming he was a Marine law enforcement officer. After he made it inside a protective zone, Magnan, who was not in a Marine Corps uniform \"as in common practice during active presidential travel,\" was approached by Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office deputy, a Secret Service agent said in court documents. The deputy then contacted the Marine Corps unit responsible for Trump's transportation, who then told them Magnan's credentials were counterfeited. After being confronted by the deputy, Magnan claimed he was a \"retired\" member of the Marine Corps' presidential entourage. An investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service revealed that Magnan was dishonorably discharged in 2010. Florida Department of Law Enforcement records also revealed he is a registered sex offender. NCIS and the Secret Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Magnan is accused of impersonating a law enforcement officer, which carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Magnan posted a $100,000 bond with the help of his mother and was released on Monday. Trump arrived back to Washington on Sunday after spending roughly two weeks at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Security lapses within Mar-a-Lago have been discovered throughout Trump's presidency. Jing Lu, a 56-year-old Chinese national, was arrested for trespassing on Trump's resort in December. Lu, who had an expired visa, returned back to the resort to take photos after being instructed to leave the premises, authorities reportedly said. In September, 33-year-old Chinese national Yujing Zhang was found guilty for trespassing on the resort. She was discovered carrying several electronic devices, including a thumb-drive containing malware. The Secret Service in a previous statement to WIRED said it is not responsible for the resort's guests: \"The Secret Service does not determine who is invited or welcome at Mar-a-Lago; this is the responsibility of the host entity,\" the Secret Service's statement said. \"The Mar-a-Lago club management determines which members and guests are granted access to the property.\" Read the original article on Business Insider",
    "[] The Trump administration announced fresh sanctions on Iran Friday following Tehran’s missile strikes on an Iraqi military base housing American troops. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a press conference Friday that the U.S. had sanctioned eight Iranian officials as well as companies in the country’s steel, metals, and mining sectors. Russians Think Soleimani Was Great, and Trump’s a Big Loser Several of those companies have been blacklisted, meaning American individuals and entities are barred from doing any business with them. The Iranian officials sanctioned include the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian armed forces and the head of the Basij militia of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). “The president is issuing an executive order authorizing the additional sanctions against any individual owning, operating, trading with, or assisting sectors of the Iranian economy,” Mnuchin said during the press conference, adding that the sanctions would cut off “billions” of dollars from Tehran’s economy. The sanctions are part of the Trump administration's years-long campaign to wage economic warfare on Tehran through its so-called maximum pressure campaign. That campaign has designated more than 1,000 Iranian entities, hitting Tehran’s most critical and prosperous industries, including the petrochemical and oil sectors. The newest sanctions attempt to prohibit Tehran’s access to its financial reserves. “There’s about 70 to 80 billion sitting in these accounts across the world that the administration could overnight prohibit access to,” Mark Dubowitz, the CEO of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said. Pompeo and Mnuchin’s announcement comes nearly one week after the U.S. targeted and killed Iran’s top military commander Qassem Soleimani —which was a clear departure from previous policy. Until last week the administration had focused most of its efforts on exacting financial punishments against Iran and had refrained from engaging with Tehran militarily. Since the strike on Soleimani, members of Congress have pressured President Donald Trump to return to the status quo—to sanction Iran for its actions and to avoid hitting back militarily. The original goal of implementing financial sanctions on Iran was in part to try and convince Tehran to come back to the negotiating table on the nuclear agreements. Since the beginning of the campaign, the U.S. and Iran have through intermediaries discussed the possibility of starting official talks on the deal. But since the Soleimani assassination, Iran experts as well as current and former U.S. officials tell The Daily Beast that it is not likely the two sides will engage diplomatically in any meaningful way in the near future. “Iran has already stepped back further from its commitments under the nuclear deal following Soleimani’s assassination,” said one former Obama administration official who worked on Iran policy. “I don’t see them moving forward on the nuclear deal talks right now.” Team Trump Thought It Could Contain Iran With ‘Maximum Pressure.’ The Attacks Got Worse.

    "[] Hours after former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg announced his presidential campaign was spending $10 million for 60 seconds of ad time during the Super Bowl, the Trump reelection campaign announced that it would be running a 60-second Super Bowl ad of its own at the same price. “The biggest point is getting under Trump’s skin,” Bloomberg spokesman Michael Frazier told the New York Times. “The ad is part of Mike’s strategy of running a national campaign that focuses on states where the general election will be decided, parts of the country that are often overlooked.” The Super Bowl ad is the latest move in an unorthodox, nationally oriented primary strategy that has seen the Bloomberg campaign spend almost $170 million on television and digital advertising since launching in early November, according to Advertising Analytics. Bloomberg’s attempt to get “under Trump’s skin” appeared to gain traction after the Trump re-election campaign, which has raised a massive war chest over the last few months, announced plans to buy its own 60 seconds of ad time for Super Bowl Sunday. According to Politico, the 60-second ad or pair of 30-second commercials — the campaign has yet to finalize its plans — will run in the early part of the game. The campaign also said it had been discussing the ad for months with Fox, which has the broadcast rights to the game. “The president’s decision to stay aggressive and keep the campaign open after his first election gave us a huge head start on his reelection,” Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement on the purchase. “Now 300 days out we are throttling up. The president has built an awesome, high-performance, omnichannel machine and it’s time to give it some gas.” Trump Campaign to Withhold Credentials for Bloomberg News Due to Refusal to Investigate 2020 Dems Bloomberg News to Refrain from Investigating Dem Presidential Candidates Warren Slams Bloomberg 2020 Run: Billionaires Shouldn’t ‘Come and Buy Elections’",
    "[] Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) believes his fellow Republican lawmakers who pushed back against the Trump administration's classified briefing on the killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani are \"overreacting.\" The briefing was held on Wednesday, covering the airstrike authorized by President Trump last week that left Soleimani dead. In the wake of the airstrike, Iran retaliated on Tuesday with its own missile attacks against two Iraqi bases hosting U.S. troops. After the briefing, an angry Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) called it \"insulting\" and the worst he's ever heard regarding a military issue. He also revealed lawmakers were told there couldn't be any \"divisions\" or \"dissension\" because it would \"send the wrong signal to the Iranians, and I think that's completely wrong.\" Lee said that the meeting convinced him to support the Democratic plan for a new war powers resolution. Graham downplayed the criticism, telling reporters, \"I think they're overreacting, quite frankly. Go debate all you want to. I'm going to debate you, trust me. I'm going to let people know that in this moment in time, to play this game with the War Powers Act, which I think is unconstitutional, whether you mean to or not, you're empowering the enemy.\" More stories from theweek.com\nTrump now says climate change is 'serious' and not 'a hoax'\nIran denies shooting down Ukrainian airline, Ukraine is unsure, but evidence is mounting\nTrump tells Toledo rally he 'saved' Ethiopia, laments he didn't get the Nobel Peace Prize for it",
    "[] They came to pray with their president, though in truth many came just to worship him. Donald Trump’s Friday launch of his so-called “coalition of evangelicals”, an attempt to shore up the support of the religious right ahead of November’s election, had the feel of any other campaign rally, except this time with gospel music. An estimated 7,000 “supporters of faith” packed the King Jesus international ministry megachurch in Miami to hear the word of the president, and decided that it was good. The Maga hat-wearing faithful cheered Trump’s comments on issues calculated to resonate with his churchgoing audience, including abortion, freedoms of speech and religion, and what he claimed was a “crusade” from Democrats against religious tolerance. “My administration will never stop fighting for Americans of faith,” Trump said at the conclusion of an often freewheeling 75-minute speech. “We will restore the faith as the true foundation of American life.” Trump also gloated about Thursday’s military strike that took out the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in Baghdad. “It was flawless strike that eliminated the terrorist ringleader,” he said, insisting the killing would save the lives of “hundreds and hundreds of Americans. “His atrocities have been stopped for good. He was planning a very major attack and we got him.” Absent from his remarks, however, was any discussion of one of his signature policies, the hardline crackdown on immigration that has seen thousands of undocumented migrants deported. At this Hispanic megachurch, where even the pastor acknowledges many in his congregation are in the country illegally, perhaps that was no surprise. Trump did concede he had made it harder for foreigners to enter or stay in the US, but only to “make sure foreign terrorists cannot obtain admission”. It was exactly what evangelical Christians in the audience wanted to hear. Some, like Michael David Layne, a 62-year-old US army veteran who regularly attends the King Jesus church, marries what he sees as Trump’s “strong leadership” with “solid Christian values”, which he said the president showed in Thursday’s military strike. “We can get anybody, anywhere, anytime, anywhere there is terrorism,” he said. Layne acknowledges that Trump’s life – which includes three marriages, adultery and alleged affairs with porn stars – might appear less than pious, but is able to overlook it. “He might be a little rough around the edges for some people, but he says it like it is, and if some of the things he says or the actions he takes upset some people it doesn’t make him less of a man of God.” Others who came to hear Trump preach were similarly unfazed by the president’s questionable religious credentials. “I believe he has moral character and that he is a man of God,” said Steven Johnson, 65, from New Jersey. “I also believe that he believes people have to pick up the banner and do what’s right. If you don’t pick up the banner then are you really Christian? “It sickens me the people that say they’re Christian, and they’re praying for people, but they’re stabbing them in the back. It’s a shame. We need a revival in this country and get back to common sense, moral values. We’ve gone way off the deep end.” The need for some kind of national restoration of faith was a topic Trump returned to more than once. “For America to thrive in the 21st century we must renew faith and family as the center of American life,” the president said during one plainly scripted part of his speech. “Faith-based schools, charities, hospitals, adoption agencies, pastors were systematically targeted by federal bureaucrats and ordered to stop following their beliefs,” he said, without evidence. Friday’s rally, hastily organized in the wake of a stinging Christianity Today editorial last month, recognized Trump’s need to retain the loyalty of the evangelical voting bloc that propelled him to victory in 2016. Four years ago, he won 80% backing from white evangelical voters nationwide. “In 2016 evangelical Christians went out and helped us in numbers never seen before. We’re going to blow those numbers away in 2020,” Trump said. “I really believe we have God on our side.” For Rose Ann Farrell, 74, from Florida, the claim rang true. “I really believe he was sent to us,” she said. “From one to ten, he’s a ten. He lives in a Christian world and we needed a strong Christian, somebody who is not afraid. He speaks for us, has the guts and courage to speak what we want to say. His actions, his intentions, are Christian.” Not everybody agreed. Francisco Morales, 47, traveled 30 miles from Fort Lauderdale with placards highlighting the Ten Commandments he says Trump has violated. “He’s everything a Christian shouldn’t be. He’s about money and himself, he uses God’s word to his benefit, he doesn’t respect Christian holidays, he insults everyone. And he dishonors his wife, his daughter and all women,” Morales said. “These people waiting in line for five hours, listening to wonderful Christian music, once they get to that sacred auditorium they hear Trump insult other people … It’s a holy place but Trump does not respect that.” Florida’s Democratic party, meanwhile, rolled out some religious figures of their own to counter Trump’s appearance. Doug Pagitt, a pastor and executive director of Vote Common Good, an organization that mobilizes voters of faith, decried Trump’s event as a sham. “He’s trying to use this rally and this base to give cover for his broken promises and his immoral policies,” Pagitt said. “It is Trump’s desperate response to the realization that he’s losing his primary voting bloc, faith voters. He realizes he needs every last vote if he wants a shot at re-election [and] losing even five per cent ends his chances. “Voters know that their faith does not depend on the power of the presidency.”",
    "[] A slate of endangered House Democrats is coalescing behind Joe Biden for president as the Iowa caucuses approach — a surge of support triggered by fears that Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren at the top of the ticket would cost them their seats. More than a dozen swing-seat freshmen have taken part in at least one private call session with Biden, Amy Klobuchar or Pete Buttigieg in recent weeks. A handful have already gravitated toward the former vice president, and more are expected to follow before Democrats start voting on Feb. 3, according to interviews with 15 lawmakers, aides and campaign strategists. Others are still hearing out Klobuchar — who held her own call with a dozen members on Monday night — and Buttigieg. Both candidates are pitching themselves as middle-of-the-road Democrats who can stem the leftward surge of the party. “I’m looking at all the moderates in the race,” said Rep. Anthony Brindisi (D-N.Y.), who holds a GOP-leaning district in upstate New York. “If we’re going to campaign on issues like Medicare for All and free college for everybody, we’re not going to have a winning message in 2020.” House Democrats in battleground districts are anxious for a moderate to lead the ballot in 2020, warning that a self-described socialist like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or liberal icon like Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) could hurt their own chances in the fall — and help reelect President Donald Trump. Most won over independents and moderate Republicans to flip long-held GOP districts in 2018. Some say a more liberal nominee threatens to shatter their electoral coalitions, and they have the data in their districts to prove it. A number of Democratic centrists — some of whom hold seats Trump carried by sizable margins — have studied internal polling showing Biden outperforming other Democratic contenders in head-to-heads with Trump in their respective districts. \"The wrong person at the top of the ticket — and I’m not saying who that is — there would be down-ballot carnage all across the country, and I think that people are starting to recognize it,” said Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), a national co-chair of the Biden campaign. Unlike in 2016, when most Democrats rallied around Hillary Clinton, most have so far\nstayed on the sidelines\nof the party's primary fight, anxious of drawing battle lines that could further divide their district or attract a primary challenge from the left. But an increasing number of centrists are quietly engaging with campaigns, particularly Biden, through conference calls and staff-to-staff contact, in the run-up to Iowa’s caucuses. Biden is leading the congressional endorsement race among the presidential hopefuls. He has 33 in total, including five Democrats in Trump-won House or Senate seats, the most of any presidential contender. Democratic Reps. Elaine Luria of Virginia, Abby Finkenauer of Iowa and Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania — all of whom hold seats Trump carried in 2016 — backed Biden this month. On a November call with Biden, some freshman members cited internal polling that showed the former vice president as the most formidable candidate in their swing-seats. A number of battleground Democrats commissioned a round of polling in the late summer and fall that tested Biden and other candidates against Trump. Biden performed more favorably, according to sources familiar with the surveys, though they cautioned that some tests had very small sample sizes and that Biden’s dominance is not unexpected given his high name ID. “I am definitely concerned that someone who's more on the fringes would have a hard time winning our state themselves, and I want a Democratic candidate to win Pennsylvania and win the presidency,” said Lamb, who endorsed Biden last week and is going to campaign with him this month in New Hampshire. Asked if Warren or Sanders — the top two candidates in a new Iowa poll released Friday — could win his district, Lamb said: “I think it would be really hard.” Democrats are also looking seriously at Klobuchar, who pitched her own ability to carry districts where Trump won in 2016 in her Monday night conference call. The calls aren't the only contact between moderate Democrats and like-minded presidential candidates. Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg will meet with the over-100-member New Democrat Coalition next week, and the group is also in the process of setting up meetings with Biden and Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), according to multiple people familiar with their outreach. Biden, in particular, forged personal ties with many newly elected freshmen during the 2018 midterm elections, campaigning for more than 20 House candidates in states like Pennsylvania, Iowa, Michigan, South Carolina and Nevada. Biden’s electability is a key message for his campaign. His wife, Jill, singled out freshman Rep. Ben McAdams (D-Utah) during a fundraiser in Salt Lake City this week,\ntelling donors\nthat his reelection would be easier with a presidential nominee that \"every Democrat can run with, not run away from.” McAdams has not endorsed but said he would like to see a moderate candidate leading the party. Asked if Sanders or Warren could hurt his chances of winning a deep red seat, he suggested he would need to distance himself from a nominee with their profile. “My ideas are different than theirs.” he said. “So as long as people understand that I’m going to be independent of any candidate and really be true to my district, I think that’s most important.” For Democrats, the endorsement calculus is personal. Throwing in their name early for a candidate could help curry favor or gain a position in a Democratic administration. But some Democratic consultants say privately they see little upside to making an early endorsement, warning members will be tied to the eventual nominee even if they supported another contender in the primary. Members of Congress largely appear to be giving more careful consideration to endorsements this time around, unlike in 2016 when lawmakers flocked to Clinton and largely underestimated Sanders’ staying power. Moderates see another lesson from 2016: Clinton won the popular vote nationwide but came up short in purple states that ultimately sealed Trump’s victory. “A lot of us that come from districts where Trump won recognize the importance of bringing people together,” said Rep. Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.), who also has not backed anyone in the presidential race. “And I think those people who won those districts are probably more drawn to who can reach across the aisle.” Progressives, however, have long fought back the notion that a Democratic nominee must pick up support from independents and even Republicans in order to beat Trump. They argue that robust voter turnout — turning out the kinds of numbers that Sanders and Warren have seen at events across the country — will be key to winning back states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. Klobuchar's congressional allies, like freshman Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), argue the opposite. “I tell people all the time, enjoy reading your national polls, but care about six of them,\" Phillips said, arguing that the race would instead come down to a few battleground states mainly in the Midwest. \"That’s what this next election is about.\" “We’re no longer a country that is really fighting for their respective bases,\" said Phillips, who organized the call with Klobuchar and his colleagues this week. \"It’s fighting for the diminishing number of people who really do vote on both sides of the aisle.\" Laura Barrón-López contributed to this report.",
    "[] A slate of endangered House Democrats is coalescing behind Joe Biden for president as the Iowa caucuses approach — a surge of support triggered by fears that Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren at the top of the ticket would cost them their seats.

PEOPLE can exclusively announce that the Fox & Friends Weekend alumna is leaving the ABC talk show to help run her father Jon Huntsman Jr.’s campaign for governor of Utah. Huntsman, 33, joined the show at the start of season 22 in September 2018; the show is currently in its 23rd season. Huntsman will announce her last day on-air Monday. “Family has always been my number one priority, and is where I need to be focused at this time,” Huntsman said in a statement. “We are incredibly close and are there to support and help each other when it matters. It’s not often there is a political campaign that involves someone you love and believe in, but this is one of them.” “I’m so thankful for this opportunity and for ABC believing in me,” continued the co-host, who shares 7-month-old twins Ruby Kate and William Jeffrey and 2-year-old daughter Isabel Grace with husband Jeffrey Livingston. “It was always a dream to sit at The View table. I have the deepest gratitude for all of my co-hosts and the team at The View who don’t get enough credit for what they do every day — I’ve learned so much from each of them and this will always be a special place to me.” RELATED: Abby Huntsman Returns from Maternity Leave After Welcoming Twins, Talks Daughter’s Time in NICU Said The View executive producers Hilary Estey McLoughlin, Candi Carter and Brian Teta in a statement, “Abby brought a unique, intelligent, insightful and relatable voice to our table. While we are sad she has made the decision to leave, with Abby, family always comes first and we admire her commitment as she moves on to this next exciting chapter with her father’s campaign for governor and to spend more time with her young family.” “We will miss her warm presence at the studio both at the table and behind the scenes,” they continued. “She will always be a part of our family at The View and ABC News and we welcome her back to have a seat at the table anytime.” Huntsman, whose title will be senior advisor of her father’s campaign, will commute to Utah for the time being. RELATED: Meghan McCain and Abby Huntsman Open Up About Their Friendshi, The View and Donald Trump Jr. The TV personality also addressed her exit in a heartfelt note to the staff of the show, saying, “To the Best Team in TV, ABC has been my family for a long time and I am so thankful to have had a seat at the table on an iconic show like The View. After much deliberation over the holidays, I have decided to leave the show to dedicate myself full-time in support of my dad and his campaign for Governor of Utah.” “You know I think the world of all of you,” she continued. “You’re some of the most talented, hard-working and genuine people I’ve ever worked with. The staff is the engine of the show and you never get enough credit for what you do. I applaud you and thank you for welcoming me to the family on day-one.  You always made me look much better than I ever could have on my own. Thank you for believing in me and for all the laughs along the way.” “ABC will always hold a special place in my heart, and so will all of you,” she added. “I hope you will be in my life for years to come.” RELATED VIDEO: Meghan McCain Faces Donald Trump Jr. on The View — ‘You and Your Family Have Hurt a Lot of People … Was It Worth It?’ McLoughlin, Carter and Teta issued their own note about the “bittersweet news” to staff, writing, “Abby Huntsman is leaving The View to help run her father’s campaign for Governor of Utah and to spend more time with her young family. As you will see in her note below, she made the tough decision to move on over the holiday break.” “From the moment Abby joined us a year and a half ago, we knew how important her big family is to her,” they continued. “Isabel charmed us each time she came to the show and we shared Abby’s journey as she welcomed her twins, William and Ruby. Her dedication to family is what is launching Abby’s next exciting chapter.

    "[] People in Iowa and across America feel it in their bones: Our democracy has been hijacked by the rich and powerful. You can see it in these past three years of cruelty and criminality under Donald Trump — and in the preceding four decades of stagnant wages, rising costs and diminishing opportunity. The most powerful people in our society have used money and influence to make Washington work for them — and leave everyone else behind. It’s corruption, pure and simple. I’m running for president to do something about it. And here’s the good news: Around Iowa and around this country, Democrats, independents and Republicans are united in their desire to clean up corruption in Washington and build an economy with more growth, more opportunity and more freedom. That’s our path to beat Donald Trump in 2020. We will beat the most corrupt president in American history by campaigning on the most aggressive anti-corruption platform since Watergate. We will beat a president who has enriched himself and his rich buddies by campaigning on big, structural changes that ensure the economy works for everyone. For me, this is personal. I grew up in Oklahoma on the ragged edge of the middle class, and I devoted my career to figuring out why hard-working people go broke in the richest country in the world. I never in a million years thought I’d end up in politics, but when I saw how the system was rigged against working families, I got into the fight to help families like the one I grew up in. John Delaney: On health care, bold vision with pragmatism is what America needs Over the last year, I’ve held over 100 events in Iowa — from Orange City to Keokuk and Decorah to Pacific Junction. At every stop along the way, I’ve been talking about my plans: universal child care and high-quality early education; universal free college and student loan debt cancellation; expanded Social Security benefits; and Medicare for All so everyone gets the care they need and no one goes broke paying for it. Each of these plans would be life-changing for millions of Iowans and Americans. Taken together, they represent the big, structural change we need to rebuild the middle class, help close the racial wealth gap, and ensure that no matter where you live or who you are, you have the opportunity to follow your dreams and fulfill your potential. I believe in change and I know we can get it done. Why? Because we’ve done it before. Even before 2008, when an out-of-control Wall Street crashed our economy and wrecked the lives of millions of Americans, I had an idea. We needed a consumer agency that would protect people when they got mortgages, credit cards or payday loans — just like existing federal watchdogs protect people when they buy toys or toasters. After the crash, I went to Washington and talked to everybody I could about this idea. They all said the same two things: First, it’s a great idea; second, it’ll never happen and you shouldn’t even try. The big money and the big banks will fight you, they said. The Republicans will fight you — heck, even a bunch of the Democrats will fight you. You’ll never get this done. Joe Biden: Worse than even his policies, Donald Trump is destroying America's soul I didn’t like that answer, so I fought anyway. And you know what? We got it done. President Obama supported my idea, signed it into law, and asked me to get it off the ground. And less than a decade later, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has forced financial institutions to return $12 billion to 29 million people they cheated. Here’s what I learned from that experience: You don’t get what you don’t fight for — and you have to be willing to stand up to the powerful interests that will do anything to block reform. We’ll win this election by showing the American people that we can clean out Donald Trump’s corrupt Washington and deliver the big changes that actually affect our lives. That’s what I’m running on and that’s what I’ll do as president. Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, is a Democratic candidate for president. Follow her on Twitter: @ewarren.

    "[] Associated Press/Evan Vucci Fifty-six percent of American voters say they disapprove of how Trump has handled the situation with Iran, according to a poll conducted by Ipsos. Fifty-two percent of Americans say the airstrike ordered by President Trump to assassinate Iranian General Qassem Soliemani has made them less safe. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Americans by and large do not approve of how President Trump is handling the situation with Iran, according to a new poll. Fifty-six percent of American voters say they disapprove of how Trump has handled the situation with Iran, according to a poll conducted by Ipsos for ABC News. On top of that, 52% of Americans say the airstrike ordered by President Trump to assassinate Iranian General Qassem Soliemani has made them less safe. And, a net total of 94% of Democrats and 52% of Republicans said they are either somewhat concerned or very concerned about entering into another war in the Middle East. Only 43% of Americans approved how Trump is handling the situation with Iran. The poll was conducted between January 10 and 11 and surveyed 525 US voters over the age of 18. Trump ordered the drone strike that killed Soleimani on January 3. On Thursday, Trump said at a press conference he ordered the strike because he had recieved intelligence that Soleimani was plotting to bomb the US embassy in Iraq. \"We did it because they were looking to blow up our embassy,\" Trump told reporters. \"We also did it for other reasons that were very obvious. Somebody died, one of our military people died, people were badly wounded just a week before.\" That assertion has been called into question by congressional Democrats and other officials in recent days. On Sunday, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper backed up Trump's claim of an imminent threat on multiple embassies during an appearance on  CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" but said that he hadn't directly seen evidence of potential threats on embassies, as Trump had said.

    "[] WASHINGTON — FBI Director Christopher Wray outlined a series of proposed reforms Friday aimed at bolstering public confidence in sensitive surveillance operations in wake of a damning report that revealed flaws in how the bureau handled wiretap applications for a former Trump campaign aide. In a filing ordered by the chief judge of the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, Wray pledged that the bureau would overhaul its training program for agents and lawyers to ensure that information used to support future surveillance applications is complete and properly vetted. The plan comes more than a month after the Justice Department's inspector general identified 17 inaccuracies in requests to wiretap former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page in 2016 and 2017. The surveillance of Page, whom the FBI believed was conspiring with the Russian government, was conducted as the FBI investigated Russia's efforts to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. \"The FBI has the utmost respect for this court, and deeply regrets the errors and omissions identified by the (inspector general),\" Wray wrote, adding that the Justice watchdog's report described \"conduct that is unacceptable and unrepresentative of the FBI as an institution.\" Trump's response: Trump claims DOJ inspector general report shows 'attempted overthrow' of the government Wray described the surveillance authority provided by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which is approved by the court, as \"an indispensable tool in national security investigations.\" \"In recognition of our duty of candor to the court and our responsibilities to the American people, the FBI is committed to working with the court and (Justice Department) to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the FISA process,\" Wray wrote. The centerpiece of the training regimen, as outlined in the FBI filing, is the proposed creation of a \"case study\" based on the inspector general's findings in the Page surveillance applications. Wray ordered that the training program be created by April 30 and is requiring that all agents and lawyers who staff FISA complete the training by June 30. \"I am determined that operational personnel understand, holistically, what occurred during the activities reflected in the (inspector general's) report, and that, in addition, personnel working on FISA applications understand the importance of rigor during each and every phase of the application process,\" the director wrote. After the inspector general's report was released, Judge Rosemary Collyer, chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that considers the sensitive wiretap applications, rebuked the FBI and asserted it had misled the court when seeking permission to wiretap Page. \"The frequency with which representations made by FBI personnel turned out to be unsupported or contradicted by information in their possession, and with which they withheld information detrimental to their case, calls into question whether information contained in other FBI applications is reliable,\" Judge Rosemary Collyer wrote. Searing IG report: FBI wiretap of Trump campaign aide was riddled with errors, but Russia probe was legally justified, IG report finds Wiretap trouble: A new blow to the FBI: Watchdog report details dysfunction, missteps in wiretap of Trump aide In its filing, the FBI was required to show the court how it would adhere to the rules governing requests for surveillance allowed under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The law, enacted in 1978, outlines procedures investigators must follow when they ask judges for permission to conduct electronic surveillance of people suspected of acting as foreign agents. Although the inspector general debunked claims by President Donald Trump that the Russia investigation was motivated by political bias, it revealed a dysfunctional system in which a team of investigators, handpicked to conduct one of the FBI's most sensitive investigations, committed \"basic and fundamental errors.\" The FBI sought four court-ordered wiretaps of Page. Each application contained multiple errors, according to Inspector General Michael Howoritz's report. Among the most common were omissions of important information, including some that contradicted investigators' suspicions that Page was acting as a foreign agent. During Senate testimony last month, Horowitz said the surveillance of Page continued even as investigators gathered new evidence \"that weakened the assessment\" of Page's activities.. Horowitz's report concluded that investigators overstated the reliability of a former British intelligence officer whose information they used to justify the surveillance warrants. Agents described Christopher Steele as someone whose information had been \"corroborated and used in criminal proceedings.\" Horowitz's report said that wasn't true. Investigators also didn't provide documentation to back up some of their assertions to justify the wiretap warrants. In some cases, the documents showed their claims were wrong. One supervisor said he didn't necessarily review full documents to make sure they supported what the agents claimed, according to the report. Horowitz referred a former FBI attorney to prosecutors for possible criminal investigation for altering an email from a liaison at another government agency. The email confirmed Page had been a source of information for the other agency, but the FBI attorney changed it to say the opposite. That covered up a piece of information that would have undercut the FBI's justification to wiretap Page. This, Collyer wrote in her order, \"gave rise to serious concerns about the accuracy and completeness\" of any surveillance warrant applications involving that attorney.

    "[] The House voted Wednesday to send the articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi named seven managers who will act as prosecutors in the upcoming trial — just the third such trial in American history. So what will that trial look like? And how might it work? Some of it will look familiar. A 1986 Senate resolution — “Procedure and Guidelines for Impeachment Trials in the United States Senate\" — lays out some of the ground rules. Others will be determined on the fly. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he would like it to look a lot like the impeachment trial against President Bill Clinton in 1999. Here’s a rough outline of what to expect in the coming days and weeks: Late Wednesday, the impeachment managers — seven Democratic House members, including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler — made the two-minute walk across the Capitol to physically transmit the articles to the Senate. Joined by the sergeant at arms, the House managers presented them to the secretary of the Senate late in the day, and lawmakers are to formally read the documents aloud at noon Thursday. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts will be sworn in at 2 p.m. to preside over the trial, then senators will be sworn in. Roberts will be sworn in by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the president pro tem of the Senate, and then the chief justice will administer this oath to all 100 senators requiring them to be impartial justices: “I solemnly swear (or affirm, as the case may be) that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald Trump, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws: So help me God.” Each senator will then sign his or her name in a book attesting to the oath. That includes McConnell, who has been openly coordinating with White House counsel and said last month he had already made up his mind that Trump is innocent. “I’m not an impartial juror,” the Kentucky Republican told reporters. “There is not anything judicial about it. Impeachment is a political decision ... I’m not impartial about this at all.” The Senate must then send a summons notifying Trump of the charges against him and ask for his formal reply in writing by a yet-to-be determined time. If Trump or his attorneys fail to answer the charges, the trial will proceed “nevertheless, as upon a plea of not guilty.” But if a plea of guilty is entered, “judgment may be entered thereon without further proceedings.” Before the impeachment managers and Trump defense team make their cases, the Senate must first agree on the rules for the trial, including whether to call witnesses and admit new evidence, and how long each side will be given to make their arguments. The rules require a simple majority for approval. The 1986 resolution states that senators will convene at 1 p.m. every day (except Sunday) until senators reach a verdict or dismiss the charges. That schedule has thrown a wrench into the Democratic primary, as three candidates for the nomination — Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar — must sit as jurors for six days a week while the rest of the field is free to campaign. Depending on the rules that end up passing, the Senate could have the option to dismiss the case at the outset with a simple-majority vote. This is Trump’s preferred option, but at least four Republicans say they prefer a trial and the motion will likely fail, assuming all 47 Democrats are opposed. A motion to dismiss the articles of impeachment against Clinton fell in a 56-44 vote. It is expected that, as in a regular criminal trial, both sides will be allowed to give opening and closing arguments. Because they chose not to participate in the House impeachment process, this will be the first time Trump’s legal team will have mounted a defense. But senators themselves will not actually be allowed to speak. Any questions they have will be submitted via notes and then read aloud to be answered either by Trump’s defense team or the impeachment managers. According to guidelines provided by McConnell’s office, no one in the chamber is allowed to have electronic devices, reading material is restricted to resources related to the trial and senators are supposed to refrain from talking to one another while the case is being presented. It is still to be determined if witnesses will be called. McConnell has said the decision will be made “at the appropriate time into the trial.” There are signs that a majority of senators might vote to call former national security adviser John Bolton, who is one of four witnesses Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has requested. The others are Mick Mulvaney, acting White House chief of staff; Michael Duffey, Office of Management and Budget associate director for national security; and Robert Blair, senior adviser to the acting White House chief of staff. But Republicans might insist on also hearing from witnesses who might be potentially embarrassing to Democrats, such as Joe Biden’s son Hunter. The chief justice has considerable freedom to define his role in the process, as the Constitution is quite vague on this matter, stating only, “When the president of the United States is tried, the chief justice shall preside.” In Andrew Johnson’s 1868 trial, Salmon Chase — a former governor and senator himself who was seeking the presidential nomination at the time — was very active in the proceedings. William Rehnquist kept a low profile in Clinton’s 1999 trial, except for his controversial choice of robes adorned with gold stripes. Roberts will call the Senate to order and decide when to adjourn for the day and read the questions submitted by the senators. He can turn for advice on protocol to Elizabeth MacDonough, a career nonpartisan government employee who serves as the Senate parliamentarian. The Senate can overturn any decision by the presiding officer with a simple-majority vote. If the charges are not dismissed earlier in the process, the trial will come to a close with separate votes on the separate articles of impeachment (abuse of power and obstruction of Congress). If a two-thirds majority votes to convict on either one of the articles, Trump will be removed from office and Vice President Mike Pence will be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States. If both votes fall short of the threshold, Trump will remain in office with no restrictions on his power, just like Johnson and Clinton before him, but, as Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday, “he’s been impeached forever.” Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the articles would be delivered to the Senate on Thursday. _____ Read more from Yahoo News: What are Iran's military capabilities?

    "[] Andrew McCabe will take part in a forum at New York University to address reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in the wake of the Justice Department inspector general’s report. McCabe was the FBI’s No. 2 when the FBI submitted false information to the FISA Court in order to obtain wiretap warrants against Carter Page. McCabe also pushed to include the unverified Steele dossier in an intelligence community assessment of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. Andrew Weissmann, a top prosecutor on the special counsel’s team, will also take part in the event. Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and Andrew Weissmann, one of the lead prosecutors in the special counsel’s probe, will speak at a New York University event Thursday about reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The event, called “Reforming the FISA Process: Proposals for the Future,” will address a report from the Justice Department’s office of the inspector general (IG), which found that the FBI made “significant” errors and omissions in its applications for FISA warrants against former Trump campaign aide Carter Page. McCabe had a front-row seat to the FISA failures that will be discussed at the event. He was the second-in-charge at the FBI when the bureau submitted false information to the FISA court in order to wiretap Page. He signed off on the third FISA renewal, dated June 29, 2017, when he served as acting director of the FBI. McCabe was also briefed regularly on Crossfire Hurricane, the code name for the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign. McCabe, Weissmann, Cato Institute senior fellow Julian Sanchez and Liza Goitein, an executive at the Brennan Center for Justice, will make up an “expert panel to diagnose the problems and foster ideas for solutions.” The IG found that the FBI failed to disclose information that undermined the theory that Page was a Russian agent, as well as information that called dossier author Christopher Steele’s reliability into question. Steele’s dossier, which was funded by Democrats, was “central and essential” to the FBI’s decision to seek the FISA warrants, the IG report said. But the report criticized the FBI for failing to tell the FISA Court about information that called Steele’s dossier allegations into question. The most glaring example from the report is that Steele’s primary source told FBI agents in January 2017 that the ex-spy embellished or misrepresented information in the dossier, including about Page. The information was never disclosed to the FISA Court. The IG report said McCabe was one of the FBI officials who lobbied the intelligence community to include the dossier in an Intelligence Community Assessment laying out evidence that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. The report said CIA analysts disagreed with McCabe because they felt the dossier was “Internet rumor.” McCabe also told the IG he “felt strongly” that the FBI should pursue a FISA warrant against Page. McCabe was fired from the FBI on March 16, 2018, for displaying a lack of candor to investigators regarding his authorization of a leak to the media in October 2016 for a story about the Clinton Foundation. McCabe initially touted the IG’s findings as vindicating the FBI. “I knew that we had not ever done anything wrong,” McCabe said in a Dec. 9, 2019, interview on CNN, where he is an analyst. But McCabe changed his tune a week later, after Judge Rosemary Collyer, who presided over the FISA Court, blasted the FBI for submitting “false” and “misleading” statements in order to obtain warrants to wiretap Page. He said in a Dec. 17, 2019, interview on CNN that he was “shocked and horrified” by the IG’s findings. “Shocked because we all believed, I certainly believed that the procedures we had in place were enough to guarantee that accurate information was going to the court and horrified because it cuts against one of our most fundamental duties and that is to be perfectly accurate and truthful and complete with the court at all times,” he said. Weissmann was not involved in the process to seek a FISA on Carter Page, though he did meet with the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane team in the weeks before the 2016 election. On the special counsel’s team, Mueller led the prosecution of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. He earned the nickname of “Mueller’s pit bull” because of his reputation for his aggressive prosecutorial tactics. Weissmann is an analyst at MSNBC, and senior fellow at the NYU School of Law. NYU’s Reiss Center on Law and Security, which is hosting the event, did not respond to a request for comment about McCabe.

    "[] AP House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made an unprecedented and risky call when she held off on forwarding articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump to the Senate last month. It sparked a political firestorm, and in the weeks since she has been criticized heavily. But it looks like Pelosi's gamble paid off. Since she decided to delay the process, there have been at least 10 developments that have raised the stakes of the impeachment trial and forced the GOP into a corner. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. As soon as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi decided last month to withhold the transmission of articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, critics asked whether it would be worth the risk. The California Democrat made a historically unprecedented decision when she refused to transmit the articles to the Senate, the process which triggers an impeachment trial. Pelosi's move came after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and several other Republican senators indicated that they were not only working hand-in-glove with the White House ahead of the trial, but that they would not bring witnesses in to testify. In response, Pelosi withheld the articles of impeachment, freezing the process while Democrats and Republicans duked it out over the terms of the trial. Last week, Pelosi finally announced that she would transmit the articles, after McConnell modified his position by saying that the Senate would decide whether to call witnesses after it received the articles. Republicans reacted by declaring victory, arguing that Pelosi had still essentially gained nothing. But a closer look at the timeline of events over the last several weeks paints a different picture. In fact, there have been at least 10 major developments since last month that dramatically raised the stakes of Trump's impeachment trial and forced congressional Republicans into a tighter box. The House voted to impeach Trump on December 18. A lot has happened since then: On December 21, the Center for Public Integrity obtained new documents showing that Mike Duffey, an official in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), sent an email ordering a hold on military aid to Ukraine only 91 minutes after Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He requested that the recipients of his email keep the directive \"closely held to those who need to know\" because of \"the sensitive nature of the request.\" On December 26, cracks began forming in the Senate GOP ranks. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said in an interview she was \"disturbed\" by McConnell's declaration that he was working in \"total coordination\" with the White House ahead of Trump's trial. \"We have to take that step back from being hand-in-glove with the defense,\" she said. On December 29, The New York Times reported that Trump's acting chief of staff and the head of OMB, Mick Mulvaney, was deeply involved in the administration's efforts to freeze Ukraine's military aid since as early as June 2019. Mulvaney's actions sparked alarm from other officials, like his aide Robert Blair. In response to an email from Mulvaney asking whether it would be possible to hold back the aid, Blair replied said it would be possible but warned of consequences. \"Expect Congress to become unhinged\" if the White House tried to circumvent it by withholding aid, Blair wrote in an email, according to The Times. He also said it would fuel the narrative that Trump is pro-Russia. On January 2, the national-security blog Just Security published even more emails showing how the Pentagon repeatedly warned that freezing Ukraine's military aid could violate US law. Crucially, the documents showed that the Justice Department redacted several exchanges in which a Pentagon official raised concerns about the legality of the plan. On January 6, former national security adviser John Bolton said he would be willing to testify in Trump's Senate trial. Bolton had previously refused to respond to a House subpoena for testimony because he wanted a court to rule on whether he should comply with the congressional subpoena or the White House's order not to. Bolton's announcement sent shockwaves through Washington. The former national security adviser is at the center of several key episodes in the impeachment inquiry, and his lawyer has hinted that Bolton has additional information. Bolton's announcement also made him McConnell's worst nightmare. A pivotal witness who was in the president's inner circle had stepped forward and offered to testify in a trial about the president's misconduct. Could McConnell and Senate Republicans really afford to ignore that? On January 10, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine told the Bangor Daily News that she and a \"fairly small group\" of Republican senators are working to make sure that witnesses are called during Trump's impeachment trial. Collins' revelation was significant; Republicans have a three-seat majority in the Senate, which means only four GOP lawmakers need to defect from McConnell to swing the balance. On January 13, it surfaced that hackers working for Russian military intelligence had hacked the Ukrainian natural-gas company Burisma Holdings in what appears to have been an effort to obtain dirt against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, former Burisma board member Hunter Biden. Area 1, the California-based cybersecurity firm that discovered the hack, said Russia's first attempt to breach Burisma was in November — around the same time that Trump was publicly calling for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and Burisma. On January 14, McConnell conceded to reporters that he expects some Republicans to side with Democrats in calling for witnesses in Trump's trial. Also on January 14, the House Intelligence Committee released a trove of previously unseen documents turned over by Lev Parnas, one of Trump's and Rudy Giuliani's Ukrainian associates involved in the ongoing controversy. The documents were explosive. They included handwritten notes from Parnas describing his responsibilities, which included getting Zelensky \"to announce that the Biden case will be investigated.\" They included text messages from Parnas, Giuliani, the GOP congressional candidate Robert F. Hyde, and the former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko, in which they discussed tracking the movements of Marie Yovanovitch, then the US's ambassador to Ukraine. The documents also included a previously unseen letter from Giuliani to Zelensky which destroyed the president's last defense in the Ukraine controversy. The House of Representatives formally voted to transmit the articles of impeachment against Trump to the Senate on Wednesday, January 15. But new evidence is still emerging. In fact, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, one of the impeachment managers and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters that the panel is still reviewing thousands of documents Parnas turned over and that \"it's entirely possible there will be new and important evidence that comes out of the information that we've been receiving.\" Later on January 15, NBC News reported that Parnas told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow that Trump \"knew exactly what was going on\" in Ukraine and that the president \"was aware of all [his] movements.\" \"I wouldn't do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani, or the president,\" Parnas told Maddow. \"I mean they have no reason to speak to me. Why would President Zelensky's inner circle, or Minister Avakov, or all these people, or President Poroshenko meet with me? Who am I? They were told to meet with me. And that's the secret that they're trying to keep. I was on the ground doing their work.\"  Read the original article on Business Insider",
    "[] Ukraine's interior ministry launched an investigation Thursday into claims former United States Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was placed under surveillance in the country by people linked to President Donald Trump's personal lawyer. The probe by Ukraine came after House Democrats on Tuesday released a trove of documents, including phone records, suggesting that Lev Parnas, an associate of Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, discussed tracking Yovanovitch in March 2019. Parnas is a central figure in the Trump impeachment investigation. In a statement, Ukraine's interior ministry said it does not want to interfere in U.S. domestic affairs, but it can't ignore potentially illegal activities and it needs to protect the rights and safety of foreign diplomats deployed on its soil. It said its investigation intends to determine whether \"there actually was a violation\" or \"just bravado and fake information during informal conversation between two U.S. citizens.\" Top Democrat: 'Profoundly alarming' threats against former U.S. Amb. Yovanovitch The text messages released by House Democrats showed Parnas was in contact with Robert Hyde, a pro-Trump congressional candidate in Connecticut who claimed to have Yovanovitch under surveillance. In March, Parnas sent Hyde articles critical of Yovanovitch. Hyde responded, \"Wow. can't believe Trumo [sic] hasn't fired this b****.\" Hyde also sent Parnas a series of messages suggesting he had hired people in Ukraine to surveil the ambassador and was getting updates about her whereabouts and activities. \"She’s talked to three people. Her phone is off. Computer is off,\" Hyde wrote in one message. In another: \"They will let me know when she’s on the move.\" In an interview Wednesday with MSNBC, Parnas downplayed his connection with Hyde and said he didn't believe Hyde had really hired anyone to track Yovanovitch. \"I don’t believe it’s true,\" Parnas told MSNBC. \"I think he was either drunk or he was trying to make himself bigger than he was. So I didn’t take it seriously.\" Hyde has also denied that he had Yovanovitch tracked and said he was not close with Parnas. He told a conservative broadcast outlet that he and Parnas were \"joking around on WhatsApp.\" FBI agents were at Hyde’s home and business in Connecticut on Thursday. A spokesman for the agency's field office in New Haven declined to say why agents were there, if there’s a court-ordered search, or if they’re involved in Ukraine’s investigation on the alleged surveillance of Yovanovitch. Yovanovitch was abruptly recalled from her post as ambassador in May 2019. Allies of the former ambassador say Giuliani pushed Trump to remove her because she was an impediment to the Trump administration's push for political favors from Ukrainian officials. During her public testimony, Yovanovitch told lawmakers leading the impeachment investigation that she received an unsettling phone call last April from a top State Department official, who told her she needed to leave Ukraine on the next flight home. \"This is about your security. You need to come home immediately. You need to come home on the next plane,” Yovanovitch said she was told by Carol Perez, director general of the State Department's foreign service. Ukraine-born Parnas worked with Giuliani to execute Trump's alleged Ukraine pressure campaign, which Trump's critics contend was aimed at getting dirt on his political rival, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Trump denies the allegations. On Thursday, a nonpartisan government watchdog found the White House violated federal law when it withheld military aid from Ukraine. Congress had appropriated that money, and Democrats believe Trump froze the funds as leverage in his push for an investigation of Biden. The Government Accountability Office said the White House Office of Management and Budget did not have the authority to withhold the money. \"Faithful execution of the law does not permit the president to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law,\"  the GAO concluded in a report published Thursday. \"OMB withheld funds for a policy reason, which is not permitted\" under the law. The White House disputed the GAO's findings. The White House’s decision to withhold the money is at the heart of the impeachment proceedings against Trump. Parnas said in a Wednesday TV interview that \"Trump knew exactly what was going on\" in Ukraine during the White House's alleged pressure campaign, but Stephanie Grisham, White House press secretary, pushed back Thursday in a statement, saying that the \"allegations are being made by a man who is currently out on bail for federal crimes and is desperate to reduce his exposure to prison. The facts haven’t changed – the president did nothing wrong and this impeachment, which was manufactured and carried out by the Democrats, has been a sham from the start.\" Marc Short, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, said Parnas \"will say anything to anybody who will listen in hopes of staying out of prison.\" Still, Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called the evidence revealed in the phone records \"profoundly alarming.\" In a letter he sent Wednesday night to Undersecretary of State Brian Bulatao, Engel wrote, \"Mr. Hyde claimed in one message to have 'a person inside,' presumably in the U.S. embassy in Kyiv, who is 'willing to help if we/you would like a price.' The strong implication from these messages is that someone with detailed knowledge of the Ambassador’s whereabouts and security protocols was providing that information in real time to Mr. Hyde and Mr. Parnas. I cannot overstate the profound security risk that this poses to the U.S. mission and our interests in Ukraine.\" Ukraine's interior ministry also said it was probing a suspected cyberattack by Russian military hackers on the energy company Burisma, which is at the center of the impeachment investigation because of its ties to Joe Biden's son, Hunter. Trump's impeachment trial officially begins Thursday, when House lawmakers will read aloud the articles of impeachment accusing the president of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, but it is not expected to start the trial in earnest before Tuesday. Trump's impeachment: Chief Justice John Roberts likely to speak softly, set a good example The House has already approved the articles of impeachment. A two-thirds majority of the Senate would be required to convict and remove Trump from office, which is unlikely because Republicans there outnumber Democrats 53 to 47.

    "[] Can we try to take stock of these insane last 24 hours? ● First and most obviously, the articles of impeachment were delivered to the Senate. Third time in history. Consider the first two. One president fired a Cabinet official Congress basically dared him to fire—a politics fight, in other words. The whole thing was shaky enough that seven senators from the opposition party voted to acquit the president. The next president to be impeached, of course, lied about sex after being set up in a sting operation. By comparison, this president invited a foreign country to interfere in the next election. Not “allegedly”—he and his chief of staff have admitted they did it. If that doesn’t sound a lot worse to you than the first two, you have no idea what the Constitution and laws of the United States are about. ● And yet, Senate Republicans, supposedly the impartial jurors here, for the most part carry on with the up-is-down charade that it’s all a scam. Mitch McConnell, already staunchly against having John Bolton and other witnesses, has now moved to limit the Capitol Hill press corps’ ability to cover the trial. Transparency! Democracy! ● We got a look at those mind-blowing documents Lev Parnas provided to Congress, which showed that American foreign policy in Ukraine—under attack at the time from Russia—was being conducted by a group of freelance goons who a) were trying to convince Ukraine to pin a phony crime on Hunter and Joe Biden and b) claiming to be spying on the movements and engineering the firing of Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, whom they wanted to “get rid of.” No, it’s not clear that phrase was meant in its most ominous sense, but the mob talk fits right in to who these people are. ● Oh, yes, those documents also showed—for the first time—Rudy Giuliani saying that the anti-Biden plot was at Donald Trump’s direction. ● Then we had Parnas’ stunning interviews, notably the Rachel Maddow one, in which he said “President Trump knew exactly what was going on” and Attorney General Bill Barr “was basically on the team.” ● And then Thursday morning, the Government Accountability Office dropped the hammer, flatly saying that Trump’s Office of Management and Budget had broken the law by withholding Ukraine’s money: “Faithful execution of the law does not permit the president to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law.” Government Accountability Office Finds That Trump White House Illegally Held Up Ukraine Aid Is that everything? Oh, wait. For good measure, we learned that the president of the United States is a little foggy on what happened at Pearl Harbor. How foggy, I’m not sure. It turns out that back in 2018, he did, in his usual thuggish way, threaten his supposed buddy Shinzo Abe with the words “I remember Pearl Harbor.” Which of course he does not, strictly speaking, “remember,” since he was born in 1946. Now. Imagine that instead of the United States, all this were unfolding in a country where we were accustomed to seeing strongmen who perverted the government so that it was little more than an extension of their piggish and corrupt personalities, enriching themselves by the billions (or at least multi-millions) of dollars in the process. Where the strongman’s political party consisted of nothing but a collection of oleaginous yes-men and contemptible toadies. Where he drove crowds to frenzy railing against liberals and cosmopolitans and their, their, their liberal and cosmopolitan dishwashers, which failed the noble herrenvolk in just the same effete way their meddling laws did. Where the strongman, his henchmen, and the majority-party politicians placed the rule of law and democratic norms under constant attack. Where they constantly pulled the old time-honored trick of accusing the opposition party of doing exactly what they did to muddy things up and confuse people. And finally, where the state-owned propaganda network drove home, daily and incessantly, a reality that was the exact opposite of the truth. Oh, those crazy people in those unsophisticated countries, we’d cluck. Well folks, we are those people. We are that country. Speaking of those countries, I just pulled up out of curiosity Freedom House’s world freedom rankings, which it issues every year. You can look at the map. Green countries are free, yellow are so-so, blue are in trouble. The United States is still green, which is a relief. But we score 86 out of 100, which is worse than Canada (99), Australia (98), Spain (94), Chile (94), the U.K. (93), and a bunch of other places, and about on par with Mongolia (85) and Ghana (83). And we’re slipping. Freedom House ranks countries in three categories: civil liberties, political rights, and overall freedom. In 2015, we had 1 rankings in all three. By 2019, we were 1, 2, and 1.5. Think where we’ll be by 2024 if Trump is re-elected and Mitch McConnell maintains Senate power. This nation is being cheapened, weakened, destroyed. And they know it. Well, Trump may not know it. Trump is an emotional 5-year-old and a gangster whose only concern with laws is how to break them and whose only concern with corruption is how to increase it on his behalf. But the rest of them know. They know what they’re doing. Some are venal, some are just cowards, but at this point it hardly makes a difference. The end result is the same. Did you see what Susan Collins said? Is she a propagandist or just an idiot? I don’t think she’s an idiot. Her response, though laughable, showed that she can be fast on her feet. So she’s not dumb. She’s a propagandist. And she, of course, is among the least bad of them. I will be very happily surprised if four Republicans vote to have witnesses. But I doubt it will happen. McConnell shows every intention of seeking to make the trial as short as possible. I guess Vegas hasn’t established an over/under, but if you asked me to, I’d put it at five days. And I’d bet the mortgage on the under. I’d love to be wrong. But if I am, it will be an aberration, a happy accident. If after these last three years you’re still naïve enough to think that these people will follow any rule except the rule that keeps them in power, then you really should move to one of those nice places that Freedom House still scores in the 90s. Because we’re now below that, and we’re spiraling down fast. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!

    "[] \"Essere qui è sempre una grande emozione. Bettino Craxi era mio nonno, per quanto mi riguarda era una grande persona dal punto di vista politico e dal punto di vista morale, che piaccia o non piaccia\". A parlare all'Adnkronos, da Hammamet, nel primo giorno delle cerimonie per il ventesimo anniversario della morte 'in esilio' del leader socialista, è il nipote Federico Neri, figlio di Stefania Craxi (Fotogallery). Stefania Craxi: \"Grazie a popolo tunisino che ha amato mio padre e difeso sua libertà\" /Video \"Essere qui è un'emozione forte perché quegli anni li ho vissuti sulla mia pelle... Questo tema del bullismo, ad esempio, l'ho vissuto in prima persona. Si tratta di un'eredità pesante dal punto di vista personale e umano\", racconta Neri, che ricorda dei periodi vissuti a stretto contatto con il nonno. \"Io qui ad Hammamet venivo sempre, anche per lunghi periodi, di Craxi mi rimangono i miei ricordi, che nessuno può capire o interpretare. Sulla sua figura vedo ancora molta resistenza da parte di alcune persone che, per convinzione politica e personale, sono rimaste della loro idea. D'altra parte, io sono venuto qui a onorare mio nonno da un punto di vista familiare non politico\", ma \"la battaglia per riabilitarne la memoria non si fermerà mai: ora la porta avanti mia mamma e, quando sarà il tempo, la porterò avanti anche io\" (Fotogallery). Quanto ad \"Hammamet\", il film di Gianni Amelio del quale anche la figura di Neri è indirettamente protagonista, il nipote di Craxi sottolinea: \"Favino ha fatto un'ottima interpretazione di mio nonno e l'attore che ha interpretato me, anche se con un altro nome, ha preso un po' del mio carattere... Mi sono riconosciuto, è stata un'esperienza molto forte\".",
    "[] Chief Justice John Roberts has been sworn in to preside over President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, immediately administering the oath to the full Senate to ensure “impartial justice” as jurors, for only the third such proceeding in American history. Mr Roberts made the short trip across the street from the Supreme Court before being ushered to the Senate chamber. “Will all senators now stand, and remain standing, and raise their right hand,” Mr Roberts said. “Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, president of the United States, now pending, you will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws, so help you God?” The senators, at their desks, responded and then were called up to sign the oath book Mr Roberts, who has long insisted judges are not politicians, is expected to serve as a referee for the proceedings rather than an active participant. Senators will ultimately give the verdict. The Senate opened the impeachment trial at the start of the election year as Mr Trump seeks another term, a test not only of his presidency but also of the nation’s three branches of power and its system of checks and balances. Tune in as the Impeachment Managers cross the U.S. Capitol for the exhibition of the House-passed articles of impeachment. https://t.co/9z9r5xLE1s — Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) January 16, 2020 Earlier Thursday, Democrats in the House of Representatives prosecuting the case stood before the Senate and formally read the articles of impeachment against Mr Trump. “Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!” said the Senate’s sergeant at arms, calling the proceedings to order at noon. Senators filled the chamber, sitting silently at their seats under strict trial rules that prohibit talking or mobile phones, as the ceremonial protocol shifted the proceedings out of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Democrat-run House to the Republican-majority Senate. Those prosecuting the charges, led by Adam Schiff of the intelligence committee and Jerrold Nadler of the judiciary committee, made the solemn walk across the Capitol for a second day. Here we go again, another Con Job by the Do Nothing Democrats. All of this work was supposed to be done by the House, not the Senate! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 15, 2020 “With the permission of the Senate, I will now read the articles of impeachment,” said Mr Schiff, standing at a lectern in the well of the chamber, a space usually reserved for senators. “House Resolution 755 Impeaching Donald John Trump, president of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanours,” he began, reading the nine pages. Mr Trump faces a charge that he abused his presidential power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, using military aid to the country as leverage. Mr Trump was also charged with obstructing Congress’ ensuing probe. Ahead of the proceedings the Government Accountability office said Thursday that the White House violated federal law in withholding the security assistance to Ukraine, which shares a border with Russia. The president calls the impeachment a “hoax,” even as new information emerges about his actions toward Ukraine that led to the charges against him. Ms Pelosi said new allegations from an indicted associate of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas, only reinforces the need for the Senate to consider further testimony about the president’s actions toward Ukraine. Ms Pelosi noted that typically a special prosecutor would investigate but she doubted that would happen. “This is an example of all of the president’s henchmen,” Ms Pelosi said, “and I hope that the senators do not become part of the president’s henchmen.” The president has suggested recently that he would be open to a quick vote to simply dismiss the charges, but sufficient Republican support is lacking for that. Still, an eventual vote to acquit Mr Trump is considered highly likely. Opening arguments are to begin next Tuesday after the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.",
    "[] Before Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, agreed to chair the Donald J. Trump for President Pro-life Coalition in 2016, she requested a list of commitments in writing from the Republican nominee. To ensure that Trump, who described himself as “very pro-choice” not two decades earlier, wouldn’t betray anti-abortion conservatives as president, Dannenfelser asked that he promise to strip Planned Parenthood of federal funding, codify into law the Hyde Amendment limiting the use of federal money for abortions, enact legislation to ban abortion after 20 weeks and strictly nominate anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court. Despite the fulfillment of just one of those promises — two conservative Trump nominees now sit on the high court — Dannenfelser’s group is preparing to reward the president handsomely: This week, SBA List and its affiliated super PAC, Women Speak Out, will launch a grassroots effort to support Trump’s reelection and protect Republicans’ slim majority in the Senate that is part of a $52 million organizational budget for this cycle. It’s the largest election-year spend so far for the GOP women’s group, which dropped $18 million on voter contact and advertising in 2016 and $32 million in the 2018 midterm cycle. And it comes after Planned Parenthood, a leading foe of the Trump administration, committed on Thursday to spending $45 million on its 2020 effort to boost candidates who support abortion rights. The organization, which has closely aligned itself with the Trump administration (Dannenfelser’s husband is a public liaison official inside the White House), says it has visited nearly half-a-million homes across several battleground states already this cycle, and plans to connect with 4 million voters in total before the November election. “After the Billy Bush tapes came out, it was a trying time,” said an official involved with the group, referring to a recording released shortly before the 2016 election in which Trump is heard bragging about sexually assaulting women. “But we continued to support him and what we have now is the most pro-life president in American history.” Describing 2020 as “the ultimate high-stakes battle,” this person said SBA List would launch full canvassing operations in nine critical states — Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Michigan, Wisconsin, Texas, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Iowa — in addition to running digital ads and ramping up its advocacy for federal and state policy changes related to abortion access. Grassroots volunteers and paid staffers have been instructed to target traditional Republican voters, as well as Hispanic Americans and moderate Democrats “who consider themselves pro-choice but see extreme positions like support for late-term abortion, infanticide and abortion activists posing as federal judges as a bridge too far,” according to a memo describing the group’s electoral effort and obtained by POLITICO. “As we have in the last three election cycles, we anticipate that SBA List-Women Speak Out PAC efforts will impact tens of thousands of votes in key races, providing the margin of victory,” the memo states. SBA List has long been a prominent player in social conservative efforts to restrict public funding for abortion providers and limit abortion procedures to cases in which the life or health of the mother is endangered. Early in Trump’s presidency, the group was heavily involved in a push to block family-planning clinics that receive taxpayer funding from referring women for abortions or commingling their finances with abortion providers. Officials with the Health and Human Services Department began implementing the new rule last July, following the reversal of a nationwide preliminary injunction against it. Trump has also revived the so-called Mexico City Policy, a Reagan-era restriction on the flow of U.S. aid to foreign abortion providers, and expanded it to include nongovernmental organizations that provide abortion-related services or lobby for abortion rights. And both of Trump’s Supreme Court nominees, Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, were handpicked from a list developed and widely supported by conservative and anti-abortion groups. Kavanaugh and Gorsuch will be put to the test this summer, when the Supreme Court is expected to deliver its opinion on a challenge to a Louisiana law that requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at hospitals within 30 miles of their clinics. Critics of the law contend that it would leave the state with only one doctor authorized to perform abortions, while proponents have argued that it protects the health and safety of women seeking abortions. The Louisiana law is one of several momentous cases the high court is slated to rule on by the 2020 election. Anti-abortion groups, including SBA List, have used recent controversies over abortion laws in Alabama, New York and Georgia to galvanize their supporters and try to pick off independent voters who might oppose looser restrictions on late-term abortions. A June 2019 survey by Monmouth University’s Polling Institute found that one-third of U.S. voters would consider the candidate’s views on abortion as a top factor in their vote for president this fall, while another 30 percent said it would play a somewhat important role in whom they choose to support. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story suggested the full $52 million organizational budget for SBA List and its affiliated super PAC would go toward their grassroots effort to support Trump’s reelection and protect Republicans’ slim majority in the Senate.",
    "[] Before Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, agreed to chair the Donald J. Trump for President Pro-life Coalition in 2016, she requested a list of commitments in writing from the Republican nominee. To ensure that Trump, who described himself as “very pro-choice” not two decades earlier, wouldn’t betray anti-abortion conservatives as president, Dannenfelser asked that he promise to strip Planned Parenthood of federal funding, codify into law the Hyde Amendment limiting the use of federal money for abortions, enact legislation to ban abortion after 20 weeks and strictly nominate anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court. Despite the fulfillment of just one of those promises — two conservative Trump nominees now sit on the high court — Dannenfelser’s group is preparing to reward the president handsomely: This week, SBA List and its affiliated super PAC, Women Speak Out, will launch a grassroots effort to support Trump’s reelection and protect Republicans’ slim majority in the Senate that is part of a $52 million organizational budget for this cycle. It’s the largest election-year spend so far for the GOP women’s group, which dropped $18 million on voter contact and advertising in 2016 and $32 million in the 2018 midterm cycle. And it comes after Planned Parenthood, a leading foe of the Trump administration, committed on Thursday to spending $45 million on its 2020 effort to boost candidates who support abortion rights. The organization, which has closely aligned itself with the Trump administration (Dannenfelser’s husband is a public liaison official inside the White House), says it has visited nearly half-a-million homes across several battleground states already this cycle, and plans to connect with 4 million voters in total before the November election. “After the Billy Bush tapes came out, it was a trying time,” said an official involved with the group, referring to a recording released shortly before the 2016 election in which Trump is heard bragging about sexually assaulting women. “But we continued to support him and what we have now is the most pro-life president in American history.” Describing 2020 as “the ultimate high-stakes battle,” this person said SBA List would launch full canvassing operations in nine critical states — Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Michigan, Wisconsin, Texas, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Iowa — in addition to running digital ads and ramping up its advocacy for federal and state policy changes related to abortion access. Grassroots volunteers and paid staffers have been instructed to target traditional Republican voters, as well as Hispanic Americans and moderate Democrats “who consider themselves pro-choice but see extreme positions like support for late-term abortion, infanticide and abortion activists posing as federal judges as a bridge too far,” according to a memo describing the group’s electoral effort and obtained by POLITICO. “As we have in the last three election cycles, we anticipate that SBA List-Women Speak Out PAC efforts will impact tens of thousands of votes in key races, providing the margin of victory,” the memo states.

    "[] After five days of negotiations, Senate leaders and the Trump administration said early Wednesday morning they have reached a deal on a $2 trillion stimulus package to help relieve the economic impact of COVID-19. \"Ladies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,\" White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland told reporters around 1AM, according to the Washington Post. Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who negotiated with Ueland, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and other officials, are expected to discuss the deal in Senate soon. The deal still needs to be approved by the Senate and House of Representatives, but the stock market rose on Tuesday as reports came out that an agreement was imminent, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining more than 2,100 points or 11.4%.  Wall Street roars on news of potential stimulus deal, Trump hints at opening economy  The size of the stimulus package has grown over the past week, from the $850 billion that the Trump administration reportedly first asked for to the current $2 trillion. The deal includes an increase in unemployment insurance, $130 billion earmarked for hospitals, $1,200 checks to many Americans and a $367 billion loan program for small businesses, among other provisions. According to New York Times reporter Alan Rappeport, the deal also includes a provision, secured by Schumer, that bars businesses controlled by the president, vice president, members of Congress and heads of executive departments from receiving loans or investments from Treasury programs. Schumer secured a provision in the agreement that will prohibit businesses controlled by the President, Vice President, Members of Congress, and heads of Executive Departments from receiving loans or investments from Treasury programs, per senior Dem aide. — Alan Rappeport (@arappeport) March 25, 2020  President Donald Trump suggested this week that he wants to lift emergency orders much more quickly than public health experts have suggested. Yesterday Trump told reporters he wants the nation to be \"opened up and just raring to go by Easter,\" despite warnings by public health experts that more time is needed to contain the spread of novel coronavirus. According to data from John Hopkins University, there are currently more than 55,200 cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., with a total of 801 deaths. ",
    "[] Last month when the World Health Organization dubbed the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, State Department officials gave Robin Gallite and her husband Alli, both 41, a choice: Return to the U.S. from Lagos, Nigeria, quickly before the country’s airports closed and the health-care system deteriorated, or stay with their 16-month-old daughter, Nike, and risk getting stuck in the country. After applying for her adoption in 2018, Robin and Alli took home Adenike-Rae—“Nike” for short—in August from Cross River, a Nigerian state bordering Cameroon. The couple planned to stay with Alli’s family in Lagos for several months while they waited for Nike’s adoption to be finalized by local officials and until they received a U.S. visa for their daughter. They had wanted to spend time with Alli’s family before returning home to the U.S. so Robin could introduce Nike to her own mother. The couple had heard from other parents that obtaining a visa for adopted Nigerian children took months, but they were optimistic about being able to fly back to the U.S. with their daughter in the spring of 2020. That confidence quickly faded. In February, President Donald Trump placed Nigeria on his travel ban list along with other countries with predominantly large Muslim populations. Weeks later, the coronavirus epidemic ballooned, causing the closure of borders around the world and forcing Americans like Alli and Robin to scramble to find a way out on evacuation flights. The dual events left the couple with a harrowing choice: Even if they were to get on one of the few flights out of Lagos, officials told them that they would not be able to bring their daughter with them. Alli and Robin’s story may be uniquely traumatic. But it highlights the emotional and logistical difficulties many Americans are facing in trying to get back to the U.S.—difficulties that include trying to book evacuation flights, having to uproot professional and familial structures, and being forced to deal with inconsistent communication with U.S. consulate representatives. The couple’s situation exposes the real-life limitations Americans face in trying to repatriate from a country under Trump’s travel ban and raises questions about how the State Department is handling already in-process visa applications during the coronavirus outbreak. “When the pandemic hit, we were like ‘OK, we really need to get home to our families.’ And [the consulate’s] communication was ‘well you can get home to your families.’ But we couldn’t. We didn’t have the visa,” Robin said. The latest communication the couple received was in an email from the State Department. “It was something along the lines of ‘Yes, we’re very much aware of Robin’s case and it’s still processing,’” Robin said. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment for this story. As of Thursday, Robin, Alli, and Nike are still in Lagos. From their home there, the couple told The Daily Beast about their months-long struggle to try to get their daughter home to Colorado. Since the president’s February proclamation, Robin and Alli said they have continuously tried to seek guidance from State Department officials about why their child’s visa was held up and how the travel ban could affect her case. They have asked U.S. representatives—including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), a prominent advocate for adoption—to help get the family home in one unit. ‘I’m a Full Nomad’: The Americans Fighting to Get Home Robin, a deputy executive director of nonprofit art center Redline in Denver, and her husband Adebambo Alli, who goes by “Alli,” had for years thought about adopting a child. Nigeria was a natural place for them to look. Alli was born in the U.S. but spent his adolescence in Nigeria and still has dozens of family members living there. “When we decided we were going to adopt, Nigeria was the clear choice,” Robin said. “So we decided to go down the adoption path and I have to say… things were really brilliant for us.” The adoption process can be grueling for some parents. At times it can take years for agencies to match individuals with children in need of a home. But for Robin and Allison, the process of adopting Nike went smoothly. They found out within one year that they would be able to adopt her from Cross River State because of Alli’s descent. (It’s more difficult for couples without Nigerian passports to adopt outside of Lagos.) Robin and Alli said they flew to Nigeria in August to meet Nike but they were not sure how long it would take to hold their daughter in their arms. Usually, Robin said, parents have to wait to gain custody of their children and even longer to legally adopt them. “That whole situation for us was like magic that we were able to find our daughter, who at the time was only 9 months old,” Robin said. “We were able to take custody of her on the same day.” Nike’s adoption was finalized in October and Robin and Alli applied for Nike’s visa in November, thinking it would only take them a few months to collect the necessary paperwork and fly back to Colorado. For months, the plans appeared to be on track. Robin and Alli bonded with their daughter, taking her to the beach and introducing her to their family and friends in the country. In photos sent to The Daily Beast, Nike is smiling, leaning on her mother and father’s shoulders, dressed in delicate flower dresses. From those snapshots, it looks as if the three have been together forever. It’s clear Nike knows who her parents are. Alli and Robin never anticipated that a day would come where they’d have to think about going a day without Nike by their side, they said. But as the months rolled on and the State Department continued to dodge questions about Nike’s visa, worry set in. “We thought by January, ‘OK this is getting a lot longer than we expected,’” Alli said. Soon, fairly commonplace bureaucratic holdups turned into major geopolitical complications. On Feb. 21, the Trump administration announced a travel ban on Nigeria that barred Nigerian nationals from entering the U.S. because, among other rationales, the government “does not adequately share public-safety and terrorism-related information, which is necessary for the protection of the national security and public safety of the United States.” The ban came as a shock for many Nigerians, including Alli’s family members, who had for more than 10 years tried to move to the U.S. For Alli’s family, the ban was personal. And it wouldn’t just take a toll on his brothers and sisters. It was set to take a toll on his daughter, too. “A lot of these people put on hold because of the travel ban are highly educated folks and go-getters and they wouldn’t be a burden on the system. If anything, they’d be an add,” Alli said. “It just seems like for whatever reason everyone has flagged Nigeria as non-productive… or a Muslim country. They worry about security, which is very biased if you ask me.” There was a small glimmer of hope, however. Trump’s announcement said the U.S. would ban Nigerians from entering the country, but it did not say anything about visa applications that were already in process before the ban went into place. Nevertheless, by February, Alli said, they were beginning to get “a little worried.” It was then that they decided to reach out to their contacts in the U.S., including staffers for Gillibrand and Sen. Michael Bennett (D-CO), for answers. “We found out that the consulate was handing out visas on a case-by-case basis,” Robin said. “But there were no clear answers from the State Department. It was really vague on how the travel ban was going to impact adoptees. Officials in the department were telling us ‘Oh, don’t worry this isn’t going to affect you.’ But there wasn’t clear language in the proclamation that said that.” Soon, another global event would alter their plans. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus was initially disrupting travel only between the U.S. and China. But as the pandemic worsened, the administration began to put restrictions on other countries as well. As the borders closed, Trump officials, via U.S. consulates, began sending messages to Americans traveling overseas encouraging them to come back home. Nigeria has so far only reported about 170 cases, with two deaths, but there is a wide-scale lack of testing. Initially, when the State Department started emailing residents about evacuation flights last month, Robin and Alli thought they’d finally found a way out. “We really believed we’d be OK. My husband was already talking about what it would be like to take a 16-month-old on the plane. I was like ‘Ah I don’t care we just need to get on a plane and get home,’” Robin said. “I don’t think we had much trust in the U.S. government at this point but at the same time we didn’t see any reason they wouldn’t just issue the visa.” But Robin and Alli didn’t get the visa for Nike. They were offered seats on an evacuation flight from Lagos this week, but no ticket for their child. The choice to stay or go wasn’t one Robin and Alli were willing to entertain. Nike was theirs. Period. And there was not a chance Robin and Alli were going to leave their daughter on the hope that she would one day receive a visa, they said. The mere fact that officials at the U.S. consulate in Lagos offered the option to leave her behind was unworldly. “We don’t have any other children and this will probably be our only child,” Robin said. “She’s so easy and great. We’re really lucky.” Robin said the consulate in Lagos last month finished conducting interviews with the orphanage in Cross River State, which is usually the last step before a visa is issued. It’s still unclear exactly when the couple will be able to return home to Colorado and if the travel ban will limit them from doing so. Over the last few weeks, Robin has been in touch with her family and friends back home in the U.S., providing them with daily updates about their plans to get home and with photos of Nike. “The travel ban— it really is a Muslim travel ban in my opinion. It’s a racist, bigoted policy put in place by the president,” Robin said. “The whole time after it was put in place I was thinking: But they certainly wouldn’t do this to a child. But in my mind, they don’t care who it is. As long as it’s a Nigerian citizen.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!

    "[] President Donald Trump’s top adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner insisted on Thursday that the government had not built up a national stockpile of medical equipment for states to use during threats like the coronavirus since those states have strategic reserves of their own. The remark drew raised eyebrows from experts, considering presidents have dispersed supplies from the national strategic stockpiles for use by states dozens of times over the last twenty years. In fact, the Trump administration itself has dipped into the federal reserves to help states in need. Most notably, in 2017, the administration used the stockpile to send materials such as beds and medical equipment to states ravaged by Hurricane Harvey. That Kushner either didn’t recall this or had deliberately glossed over it sparked additional questions about Kushner’s suitability to play a leading role in the administration’s response to the coronavirus threat. “He doesn’t know what the hell he is talking about. He has no idea,” said Gen. Russel Honore, a retired military general who helped direct the response on the ground during Hurricane Katrina. “He must have remembered something from some slide or some speech. But that’s why people created the national strategic stockpile in the first place. It’s for those days when we can’t predict what we need. What I see is a total misunderstanding by the White House that they have a responsibility to help maintain the stockpile and help states.” Don’t Worry, America, Jared Kushner Is Going to Save You From COVID-19 Kushner’s comments came during a rare appearance before the press corps and as he is taking on a more prominent role in the administration’s response to the global pandemic. In particular, the president’s son-in-law is helping coordinate filling the gaps in the supply chain by trying to gather data on who needs what medical supplies and procuring that equipment so nurses and doctors have what they need to save lives. Kushner and other top Trump officials, including White House adviser Peter Navarro, have put together a group of officials within the larger coronavirus task force to try and pool resources from the private industry and U.S. health distributors overseas. But states are still not receiving the vital medical supplies —such as masks and ventilators—that they need to handle the surge of coronavirus patients. When asked about Kushner’s remarks on Friday, President Donald Trump exploded at the reporter posing the question, saying they should be “ashamed.” “You know what ‘our’ means? United States of America, that's what it means,” Trump said. “He said our and our means for the country and our means for the states because the states are a part of the country.” While state governments do possess their own stockpiles of equipment and supplies, the national strategic stockpile was originally designed in 1999 to help states fill the gaps when facing things like natural or health disasters. The role of the stockpile has expanded dramatically in recent years amid more frequent natural disasters. But the Trump White House’s approach to filling the supply chain gaps has been slapstick at best, officials say, in part because it was unprepared for taking the lead in responding to a global pandemic. For weeks, the administration struggled to understand which agency was responsible for studying the supply chain breakdown and which was in charge of fixing not only the dwindling medical supplies in hospitals, but also the shortages of products like toilet paper and paper towels in grocery stores. “We missed dealing with this disaster because for weeks, the White House said it was a hoax,” Honore said. “So we missed at least four weeks of anticipation and preparation on the logistics side because of our leadership.” The White House, with the help of the Department of Health and Human Services, tried to lead the government’s response to the coronavirus, reaching out to other federal agencies to take over only in certain circumstances. It wasn’t until March 18 that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) —an agency with a regional response structure—took over. By that time, weeks had passed before the Trump administration had a clear plan in place to get states what they needed quickly. “It shouldn’t be this complicated,” said Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “It’s supposed to happen like a light switch you flip on. And this should have happened a month ago. This is not inventing a vaccine, this is just shipping stuff. In these situations you want a light White House touch and you want the subject matter experts to take the lead.” It appears the administration is still scrambling to catch up. Officials inside the coronavirus task force told The Daily Beast that the data gathering on the supply chain issues had become so disjointed that the White House turned outward for help. This week the National Association of Manufacturers announced that it would survey private sector companies on medical supplies and equipment, including personal protective equipment and test kits, and would report the data back to the federal government. According to federal data, the administration has indicated only eight times in it’s contract awards since Jan. 1 that it was procuring medical supplies for the national stockpile. The contracts were doled out by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at HHS to 3M, W.W. Grainger, an industrial supply company, and C.H. Robinson, a logistics and supply company. The awards were for things like coveralls and masks and added up to about $1.6 million. During his appearance, Kushner was pressed as to why the administration didn’t have more ventilators, facemasks, and other PPEs in its stockpile—as several government bodies and medical experts have warned for years that a flu pandemic would potentially ravage the country. “The notion of the federal stockpile was it's supposed to be our stockpile. It's not supposed to be states' stockpiles that they then use,” Kushner replied. So “we're encouraging the states to make sure that they're assessing the needs, they're getting the data from their local situations, and then trying to fill it with the supplies that we've given them.” The answer confounded experts who said it fundamentally misrepresented the purpose of the stockpile, including during the Trump years. “[Kushner] was wrong,” said Samantha Montano, an expert on emergency management at the University of Nebraska- Omaha. “I don't really know what else to say about it. I don't know where his misunderstanding of what the purpose of the national stockpile (is) comes from. But it's not for just the federal government.” Kushner's words struck Montano as “horrifying.” “It demonstrates that they are not only not following the plans that have been in place for how to manage an event like this, but that they are willing to lie to the American public about it and then go change descriptions on websites to try and cover their tracks,” Montano said. On Thursday afternoon, HHS updated the portion of its website that describes the national strategic stockpile and appeared to alter it slightly to more closely coincide with Kushner’s comments on Thursday. Katherine McKeogh, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, told Politico in a statement Friday the revisions were in progress before Kushner's appearance at the Thursday briefing.

    "[] The secretive court that approves sensitive government surveillance requests said Friday that a lack of confidence in the accuracy of FBI surveillance requests \"appears well founded,\" and ordered the bureau to show whether errors in documents supporting 29 wiretap requests may have rendered the surveillance invalid. The directive from Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court Judge James Boasberg comes just days after an internal Justice Department review found new problems with the FBI's management of wiretap applications, concluding that the documents supporting the requests routinely contained errors or \"inadequately supported facts.\" A DOJ inspector general's analysis of 29 surveillance requests from eight FBI field offices during the past five years concluded that \"we do not have confidence\" that the bureau followed standards to ensure their accuracy. The report expanded on a harshly critical assessment of the FBI's surveillance activities issued in December, focusing on its handling of multiple wiretap applications for the monitoring of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. More: FBI outlines surveillance reforms after searing rebuke from court, DOJ inspector general More: FISA deal reauthorizing surveillance laws passes in the House, faces uncertain fate in the Senate In four of the 29 applications reviewed, the new report found that the supporting documents – known as \"Woods Files\" – for the wiretap applications could not be located. In three of those instances, agents did not know whether the underlying information existed at all. \"Files identified apparent errors or inadequately supported facts in all of the 25 (fully-complete) applications we reviewed, and interviews to date with available agents or supervisors in field offices generally have confirmed the issues we identified,\" the report concluded. On Friday, the surveillance court said Inspector General Michael Horowitz's assessment \"provides further reason for systemic concern.\" \"It would be an understatement to note that such lack of confidence appears well founded,\" Boasberg wrote. \"None of the 29 cases reviewed had a Woods File that did what it is supposed to do: support each fact proffered to the Court. \"It thereby reinforces the need for the court to monitor the ongoing efforts of the FBI and (the Justice Department) to ensure that, going forward, FBI applications present accurate and complete facts,\" Boasberg wrote Friday. Boasberg ordered the FBI to provide the names of all of those targeted in the 29 surveillance applications by June 15, along with an assessment of whether errors invalidated the court's surveillance authorizations. \"Maintaining the trust and confidence of the court is paramount to the FBI and we are continuing to implement the 40-plus corrective actions,\" the FBI said in a statement Friday, referring to directives issued by Director Chris Wray in December. \"Although the applications reviewed by the (inspector general) in this audit predate the announcement of these corrective actions, the FBI understands the court’s desire to obtain information related to the applications. \"In line with our duty of candor to the court and our responsibilities to the American people, we will continue to work closely with the FISC and the Department of Justice to ensure that our (surveillance) authorities are exercised responsibly.\" This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Surveillance court cites lack of confidence in FBI surveillance",
    "[] Most of the 42 million Americans who receive food stamps aren’t allowed to use them to shop for groceries online — and some lawmakers and state governments are rushing to change that as the newly jobless flood onto the rolls of the nutrition assistance program. Only six states allow online purchases with benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps. Of those, Alabama and Nebraska launched online shopping only in recent weeks as the coronavirus pandemic erupted. The situation highlights how low-income people are at increased risk of exposure to the coronavirus. Food stamp recipients include many people who are especially vulnerable, such as the elderly and people with disabilities. Now, nonprofit groups are lobbying Congress and the Agriculture Department to relax rules and encourage a rapid expansion of online shopping and delivery options. “USDA should allow it and encourage it,” Lisa Davis, senior vice president of No Kid Hungry, an organization that works on child hunger issues, said of expanding SNAP online to more states. “We should let them go as quickly as they can because people need that flexibility.” Yet it's unclear how quickly USDA will be able to move. A department spokesperson told POLITICO that the department will work with states to help them offer online shopping through the SNAP program. California is one state that has requested permission from USDA to build a program. The spokesperson said there are \"multiple, vital steps\" states need to take before beginning online grocery sales. \"Each state, its EBT processor, and potential retailers present their own mix of challenges,” he said. Congress authorized a pilot program for online shopping six years ago, but it took years to get it off the ground as officials grappled with significant technical challenges. Most SNAP recipients pay with electronic benefits transfer, or EBT, cards at stores but buying online requires adding extra layers of verification to prevent fraud or improper payments. New York became the first state to introduce a program for online grocery orders only last year. It was followed by Washington, Alabama, Iowa and Oregon. Nebraska’s program launched last week. Maryland and New Jersey were also named as participants in the pilot program, but they haven’t started offering online ordering yet. Food stamp recipients who live in states with online programs are also limited to shopping at major retailers. Amazon and Walmart are the primary retailers serving states with online systems. The department vetted retailers based on who was equipped to handle secure processing of EBT cards. SNAP benefits can’t be used to cover the cost of delivery or service fees, which can add up when the average SNAP household receives about $250 per month. USDA also said it's working on guidance for additional sellers who want to expedite their participation in the pilot. Alabama moved up the introduction of SNAP online ordering statewide because of concerns about how recommendations to stay home affects people’s ability to buy food, said Brandon Hardin, director of the Food Assistance Division at the state’s department of human resources. Wright’s Market, a local grocer, started serving a portion of Alabama last month and the program expanded to other vendors and the rest of the state when the pandemic spread, he said. “We feel like it’s a great option to help ensure social distancing measures, help folks that qualify for our program have different options in grocery store delivery methods,” Hardin said. “It’s a great tool considering the current environment right now.” States are preparing for an influx of SNAP recipients as the economy craters from massive closures across industries that have led to millions of layoffs. Hardin said that Alabama typically receives 28,000 SNAP applications processed online per month. But over a 10-day period at the end of March — right when many people began applying for unemployment benefits — the department saw 24,000 applications. Washington state, which was one of the first places to be hit by the pandemic, has seen a similar increase in signups, and officials expect participation in online ordering to rise as the outbreak continues, said Babs Roberts, director of the Community Services Division. Application rates for the state’s food assistance programs have soared about 80 percent in the last two weeks, she said. “The program itself frankly from my point of view is probably long overdue,” Roberts said. “People have been using credit cards and debit cards for a number of years, and I love that this program brings that same access and opportunity for low-income individuals. It just feels very equitable to be able to do this.” Members of Congress are trying to increase access to food delivery bought with food stamps during the pandemic beyond USDA’s online pilot program. Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) introduced a bill that would encourage retailers to deliver groceries to SNAP participants by allowing for the EBT card to be swiped at their homes or when the order is picked up at the store. It would also authorize public-private partnerships between USDA and authorized SNAP retailers to support grocery delivery and provide $500 million in funding through state agencies to reimburse retailers for grocery delivery fees for SNAP participants. Farmers dealing with dried-up revenue could also benefit from wider online purchasing with SNAP, said Wes King, senior policy specialist for the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, a nonprofit that promotes local farming. “Local farmers have responded by rapidly adopting new models and approaches to getting their products to consumers, including online sales and delivery options,” he said. “Expanding online SNAP beyond large supermarket chains would be a huge boost to small and mid-sized local farmers in their efforts to adapt to the new world we find ourselves and ensure everyone in their communities continue to have access to fresh healthy local food, including SNAP customers,” King said. Democratic lawmakers and lobbyists are also continuing to push for more money to SNAP, seeking a 15 percent boost in benefits in the next anticipated emergency relief package as a staggering number of people are filing for unemployment and may need food assistance. “As we look at all of the different efforts across the United States to make sure low-income families are being fed, it becomes clear to me that SNAP is absolutely the first responder,” Davis said.",
    "[] From Esquire \"I haven't heard about testing in weeks.\" That was the response from the President of the United States on a phone call with a group of state governors on Monday, after one of them—Steve Bullock of Montana—went through how difficult it has been for his state to get ahold of the number of COVID-19 tests they'd need to do \"contact tracing.\" That's one method by which countries like South Korea have found so much success combatting the novel coronavirus: a sprawling testing program combined with an effort to trace where infected individuals have been and who they've come into contact with, in order to contain the spread. To a certain extent, it's impossible for the United States—with its larger size and federalized structure and a legal regime more hostile to invasions of privacy than South Korea's—to do something so comprehensive. And yet our efforts have been miserably poor, in particular because we scarcely tested anyone for weeks and weeks. South Korea had its first case one day before the United States did in January, yet has administered many times more tests per capita since. South Korea has more experience dealing with epidemics of respiratory disease. But this is also heavily tied to a lack of test kits in the U.S., which the federal government failed to produce or acquire in appropriate numbers, and which has necessitated the most drastic mitigation measures: because we don't know who has COVID-19 and where, everything has to shut down. Testing is also part of the equation to get out of this extended lockdown. Yet on Monday, the president claimed he's heard nothing about testing problems. CBS News obtained audio of a call Monday between Pres. Trump and rural state governors about coronavirus. After Montana Gov. Steve Bullock discusses difficulty getting testing equipment, Trump says, \"I haven't heard anything about testing being a problem\" https://t.co/ScO2YbKZAq pic.twitter.com/YhFPpw7Gni The president's attention span rivals a nine-year-old's, but even he will have heard the near-constant discussions around the insufficient testing over the last few weeks. Even a man who uses a coronavirus briefing in the White House Rose Garden to reward the MyPillow guy with an infomercial is surely aware enough of what's going on around him to know testing is an issue. At the same Monday press conference, he proudly unveiled a new test kit developed by a private firm like it was his first-born son. This is like the president's years-long campaign where he insists that China is somehow \"paying us\" via the tariffs Trump has imposed on Chinese goods. This is simply not reality: American consumers pay the tariffs. By this point, there is no way Trump actually believes China is paying—he just thinks it sounds good, and if enough people believe it, it might as well be true. Similarly, he finds it easier to play dumb on testing than acknowledge that his administration has failed on it. Washington Governor Jay Inslee said as much to The New York Times:  “It would be shocking to me that if anyone who has had access to any newspaper, radio, social networks or any other communication would not be knowledgeable about the need for test kits,” Mr. Inslee said. “I can be assured that the White House knows very well about this desperate need for test kits.” Incredibly, that Times article boasts the following headline: \"Trump Suggests Lack of Testing Is No Longer a Problem. Governors Disagree.\" This is a classic of the Both Sides form, in which saying that one side can point to a preponderance of evidence, while the other side is engaging in insane fantasy, is considered \"biased\" or \"not objective.\" The actual truth here is easily verifiable: there are not enough tests, the governors are right, and the president is wrong. This is not a matter of opinion or debate. It is not a contrast of two different approaches to the issue, where we cannot be sure which one has greater merit. One is grounded in reality, the other is completely absurd. To do anything other than say so is a doing a disservice to readers. It also gives cover to bad-faith actors, like the president and his allies, who feast on the Objective Media's fear of accusations of bias to work the referees to their own advantage and pump misinformation into the body politic. You don't have to pretend to believe anyone cares about email protocol. There is not enough testing, and only the federal government can remedy the situation—something Bullock demonstrated, in this initially non-public call, by recounting what it's like trying to procure scarce supplies when you're on your own as a state. This is an established problem, as states and hospitals have been forced to compete against each other for resources in the absence of federal coordination. Trump's calls for states to take the lead acquiring ventilators is more delusion meant to shift the blame to others when this starts to get really bad in the next week or two. \"I don't take any responsibility at all,\" the president said. The buck stops that-a-way. The way to combat this is for the free press to call it out for what it is, and hold elected leaders' feet to the fire until they get the job done for their constituents. Not everything is a he-said-she-said. You Might Also Like HOW TO FIND THE PERFECT SUNGLASSES FOR YOUR FACE SHAPE If You Don’t Have a Denim Shirt Yet, What’s Stopping You?

    "[] Emergency management officials say they are now moving mountains of protective masks, gloves, gowns and other medical supplies to California hospitals, as the highly coveted gear has started flowing in recent days out of federal, state and local stockpiles. The vast stores of material, some kept in secret government warehouses, are now getting shipped in massive quantities: 41 million N95 protective masks, 600,000 gowns, 500,000 face shields and more than 2.3 million sets of gloves, according to state emergency officials. Details about the medical supply chain, which have thus far been shrouded in secrecy, come from confidential state briefings obtained by The Times that explain emergency efforts to keep medical facilities equipped, though the material shipped so far might be just a fraction of what's needed during the pandemic. The figures and details about supplies from federal and state stockpiles have been revealed as medical officials and unions representing their workers have also sounded the alarm about shortages of gear for beleaguered caregivers — and as the White House and some governors have clashed about respective preparation for the virus' impact. Despite the large quantities, anxiety remains high among doctors and nurses that they might burn through the gear they need as the medical crisis stretches over weeks or months, as many experts expect. \"Now that this shipment is done, and we distributed it, we’re kind of in limbo on when the next one is coming,” said Cathy Chidester, director of the L.A. County Emergency Medical Services Agency, one of the local government entities storing and delivering the gear to hospitals and clinics in their respective areas. “It’s a little tense.\" The state reports help explain a complicated and opaque procurement system, in which federal officials have shipped items and committed other assistance to state emergency officials, who then pass materials on to counties and other local entities. The state reports note that requests from local officials are “very urgent,” and they explain the process for obtaining equipment under this top-down system. Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday said that tens of millions of items had been delivered \"in just the last few days\". \"We've got a big team that's been working on this full time, and we've had some wonderful success,\" he said. While state officials routinely release summary statistics about the virus' impact, detailed information about the scale of the crisis in California has otherwise been difficult to acquire. The California Department of Public Health, for example, has refused to release detailed data on hospitals. Other records about the crisis, such as county-by-county listings of healthcare workers infected with the virus, also remain secret. The Times has made numerous requests for data that state health officials from various departments have thus far ignored or chosen to decline. But the governor's office has touted its supply effort, which appears to be meeting acute needs at some healthcare facilities. Hospitals in L.A. County, which has had more than 5,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 100 deaths, have been scrambling to keep their supplies stocked, said Chidester, who is also monitoring bed capacity at 70 hospitals with emergency rooms. The county's warehouse managed by Chidester and L.A. County’s Department of Health Services, which oversees a sprawling network of public clinics, providers and hospitals, and has remained a closely guarded secret because of the demand for medical equipment. When full, the warehouse is packed with brown shipping boxes stacked together on wooden pallets wrapped in plastic, separated in rows across its sprawling floors and reaching into vaulted ceilings. Inside the facility, county firefighters, lifeguards and disaster response workers enlisted in the distribution effort keep inventory and manage the stores. Each pallet has shipping instructions for the medical facilities that county officials are trying to help. Those have included various hospitals, elder-care centers and group homes. The recipients, Chidester said, in the last two weeks have received more than 2.7 million N95 masks, and roughly 2.3 million surgical masks, in addition to gowns and other protective equipment. Some of the items had come from the county's general stockpile for medical incidents, stores that were filled long before the coronavirus began its strain on local hospitals. Other items have come from the state's own emergency inventory. Still more had been passed through the state from federal emergency officials, she said. The recipients locally have included organizations such as Westside Regional Center, a nonprofit state contractor that helps people with developmental disabilities. Thanks to a county delivery on Thursday, its Culver City parking lot got transformed into a drive-through distribution hub where its staffers and partners could pick up needed masks. “The providers were very appreciative,” said Mary Lou Weise-Stusser, Westside's director of community services. “The masks at least give the staff a little protection. Our biggest fear is that in these congregate living facilities, if one person gets [the virus] or one staffer gets it, we’re looking at a half-dozen people being exposed.” The masks were among some 7 million distinct items, which also include hundreds of electronic ventilators for patients with critical breathing difficulties that the county has so far received from federal and state officials, Chidester said. Demand for supplies is high at medical facilities all across the county, where more than 1,200 patients infected with the disease have been hospitalized in recent weeks — including hundreds in intensive care units. The needs vary by location. At PIH Health hospitals in Downey and Whittier, for example, supplies of hand-sanitizing solution and wipes have run out. But they maintain enough N95 masks to last more than a month, said Jaime Diaz, an emergency physician who serves as the chief medical officer at the Downey facility. To conserve masks, nurses in COVID-19 wards there are told to use a single N95 mask during the day. Those who don't work with confirmed or suspected virus patients use simple surgical masks instead. That has extended the lhospital’s N95 supply from four weeks to eight weeks, he said. Chidester said many hospitals across the region have similar stories. She said she recently scrapped a system allowing the hospitals to submit orders, saying the shipments are leaving as quickly as possible upon arrival. The county had delivered most of its supplies by the end of last week. She said their delivery totals sound impressive until you remember the scores of facilities across the county — and how often doctors and nurses dispose of the equipment. \"It’s small compared to the need because of the burn rate. The burn rate kills you. Every time you see a patient, you have a certain gown on. You can walk into the person’s room for five minutes, and when you come out, you’ve got to take that gown off and dispose of it. And the same with the gloves: off and on, off and on,\" she said. In addition to supporting that operation, the county has had to decipher messages from scores of businesses offering to sell their medical products to the county amid the disaster. Some haven't been reputable, she said, while others couldn't guarantee that their products would meet federal standards. Newsom on Saturday said his office is also seeking to improve the process for prospective contractors and volunteers to offer their gear. His team launched a new website, covid19supplies.ca.gov, where businesses and others leave information about their products. Federal officials have been reluctant to discuss their inventory of emergency items, known as the Strategic National Stockpile, citing national security concerns. But they say those goods are flowing to local communities under the system. In response to questions from The Times, the Federal Emergency Management Agency this week said it had set aside nearly $500 million to help California with the cost of responding to the coronavirus — part of a broader $860 million aid plan so far. The agency also confirmed that about half of its estimated 16,000 to 20,000 ventilators have been shipped across the country, including where some governors have expressed fear that their hospitals may run out of the live-saving devices if the crisis worsens. More than 100 ventilators arrived in L.A. County last month with dead batteries, The Times has learned. State officials later helped to refurbish them. Governors and public health officials have urged President Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act to force companies to more quickly build ventilators and protective gear, and supply them to states and hospitals facing the most dire situations. Trump has resisted taking such a step, saying he would prefer to use the act as leverage to persuade manufacturers and distributors to join what he has described as a war effort. Trump has used the act three times — to force General Motors to build ventilators; to direct the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that ventilator makers get first access to critical parts; and to order 3M to prioritize orders for N95 masks from the federal government. Experts said such actions have been too limited to address what they have described as a nationwide shortage of essential equipment. Former federal officials have described the Trump administration’s efforts as being chaotic and haphazard, as agencies and White House personnel pursue different agendas. Health experts and former federal officials have urged Trump to create a unified command and control structure to spur production and delivery of masks, gowns and ventilators. “We need a command and control operation at the very top of the government, run by someone like George C. Marshall,” the general who helped lead the nation’s World War II response, said Tara O’Toole, a former Department of Homeland Security official who helped lead an outside review of the national stockpile from 2016 to 2018. “Someone has to be in charge with full authority.” So far Newsom has sought to project that authority in California, holding regular virtual press briefings and touting his administration's efforts not just on delivering gear — but also on tracking the numbers of beds available in hospitals across the state and planning to help vulnerable groups, such as the homeless. He also hasn't too vocally complained about the federal effort. Newsom told CNN last week that the state is using its own purchasing power to keep the equipment flowing as the crisis continues. \"States are getting a little bit of support, but we're going to have to be resourceful,\" he said. Times staff writer Harriet Ryan contributed to this report.",
    "[] The first government report on the state of the nation's hospitals amid the coronavirus pandemic has confirmed that they are facing severe shortages of tests, critical protective gear and the staff needed to treat and protect both patients and healthcare workers. The 34-page report released Monday was based on hundreds of interviews of administrators at 323 medical centers coast to coast from March 23 to 27. It largely validated reports from news organizations, and painted a far more dire picture than the one President Trump describes at his daily news conferences. Later, at Monday's briefing, he angrily dismissed questions about the report, which was from the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services. \"Give me the name of the inspector general,\" he challenged one reporter. \"Could politics be entered into that?\" Last week he fired another inspector general, for the intelligence agencies in retaliation for his role in events that led to Trump's impeachment. The health department's inspector general found that hospital administrators were particularly frustrated by the lack of testing. They complained that scarce resources, especially protective equipment, had to be used for patients simply suspected of having the virus because doctors had to treat them as if they were infected. \"The sooner the hospital knows whether patients are negative, the faster it can move them to a lower level of care that consumes fewer resources,\" one administrator told the government investigators. Extended stays by patients awaiting test results were also depleting stores of protective gear. One hospital reported churning through through 307 masks daily for just 23 patients. Another medical center, the report said, was using 2,000 masks a day — a tenfold increase from before the outbreak. Administrators said they were not only running short of masks and gowns but also supplies such as thermometers, disinfectants and and hand sanitizer. They were particularly concerned they would not have enough ventilators, a key tool in treating the sickest coronavirus patients. At the time of the government's interviews, some administrators noted they had not received any medical equipment from the federal government's Strategic National Stockpile. Another reported receiving equipment but said it \"won't even last a day.\" An official for a health system said it had received just 1,000 masks, half of which were for children and did not fit the staff. Unable to obtain critical gear from federal or state stockpiles, hospitals were competing with one another in the market and relying on unproved suppliers who did not always deliver what was promised, administrators said, and prices skyrocketed. \"We are all competing for the same items and there are only so many people on the other end of the supply chain,\" one administrator told investigators. Administrators expressed concern that they would face serious staffing shortages. \"Several hospitals reported that they would struggle to maintain hospital operations if even a few staff were exposed to the virus,\" the report said. Already some administrators said they did not have enough specialists to treat the sickest patients. Even if their hospitals received enough ventilators, they did not have enough doctors and nurses to operate them. \"You can build thousands of ventilators,\" an administrator said, \"but you need an army to manage that equipment and care for those patients.\" Administrators complained of inconsistent guidance from federal and state public health officials, and said that, as a result, they were wasting time educating the public about the threat of the virus. “The misinformation that is out there, and the lack of serious understanding about what we could be facing, is extraordinary,” one administrator said. The virus also was hurting hospitals’ financial well-being, administrators said, as they were forced to cut back on elective procedures to treat coronavirus patients. “Hospitals reported that their most significant challenges centered on testing and caring for patients with known or suspected COVID-19 and keeping staff safe,” the report said. “Hospitals also reported substantial challenges maintaining or expanding their facilities' capacity to treat patients.” The overall assessment was sharply at odds with the daily status reports from Trump. He and Vice President Mike Pence, the head of the president's coronavirus task force, have given daily, upbeat reports on how many masks, gloves and ventilators the federal government has distributed to hospitals. Over the weekend, the president claimed that “many hospital administrators that we’ve been in touch with, even in the really hot spots — you know what they are — are communicating directly with us that their level of supplies are meeting essential needs.” He added, “At the current time, they’re really thrilled to be where they are.\" Trump repeatedly has suggested without evidence that states and hospitals were actually to blame for not having enough ventilators. He blamed some hospital workers for a shortage of masks, suggesting personnel were hoarding or stealing them. “Something’s going on. And you ought to look into it as reporters. Where are the masks going? Are they going out the back door?” he said March 29. “And we have that happening in numerous places … I don’t think it’s hoarding. I think maybe it’s worse than hoarding.” The inspector general's report came days after Trump informed Congress he was firing Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community. Atkinson last year disclosed to Congress, as required, a whistleblower’s complaint about the president’s dealings with Ukraine, which led to Trump’s impeachment. Most federal agencies have inspectors general to act as independent watchdogs to audit and investigate their operations. The inspector general’s office for the Department of Health and Human Services has been led since January by Christi Grimm, the principal deputy inspector general. The department has not had a Senate-confirmed inspector general since 15-year veteran Daniel Levinson stepped down in May.",
    "[] Jonathan Ernst/Reuters As President Donald Trump repeatedly downplayed the severity of the coronavirus crisis, he also made a host of promises about the federal government's planned response that he has since broken. And several of the promises Trump made when he announced a national emergency to combat the coronavirus on March 13 haven't been fulfilled one month later, according to an NPR investigation. These promises include implementing drive-thru coronavirus testing in partnership with the private sector, facilitating home testing, working with Google to build a website for coronavirus screening, and stocking the US Strategic Reserve with crude oil. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. When President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on March 13 amid the coronavirus pandemic, he made a series of promises about the federal government's planned response that have not been fulfilled one month later, according to an NPR investigation. Since then, the number of coronavirus infections in the US has skyrocketed from about 1,700 to more than 560,000. The number of deaths has grown from 40 to nearly 23,000. A national shortage of tests What Trump said on March 6: \"Anybody that needs a test, gets a test ... They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful.\" He added later that day, \"Anybody that wants a test can get a test.\" The reality: This was a false statement on March 6 and it has remained untrue since then. Due to a national testing shortage, testing for the virus is largely limited to those showing symptoms and healthcare workers at a high risk of contracting the virus. A shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) What Trump said on March 28: \"We're going to have plenty\" of ventilators, the life-saving breathing-assistance machines, to deal with the crisis. The reality: States across the country are facing shortages of ventilators. On March 30, Federal Emergency Management Agency officials told House lawmakers that the shortage in the machines would likely worsen as the country reaches its peak in infections. Just 8 drive-thru COVID-19 testing sites What Trump said on March 13: \"We've been in discussions with pharmacies and retailers to make drive-through tests available in the critical locations identified by public health professionals.\" The reality: As of April 13, there are just 8 drive-thru testing facilities across the country. Walmart has opened two testing sites, Walgreens has opened another two, and CVS is operating four sites, NPR found. A target spokesperson told NPR that the company has \"no formal partnership with the federal government\" and is waiting for the government to \"activate\" their efforts. No at-home COVID-19 testing What was said on March 13: Bruce Greenstein, executive vice president of home healthcare company LHC Group, announced at the March 13 press briefing that his company would partner with the federal government to offer at-home testing. \"For Americans that can't get to a test site or live in rural areas far away from a retail establishment, we're here to help and to partner with our hospitals and physicians, as well as the people we have here today that will be doing testing around the country,\" Greenstein said. The reality: Greenstein told NPR that the company hasn't yet implemented any in-home testing, but that it would start working with a New Orleans hospital to do so \"as soon as next week.\" No Google-engineered website for COVID-19 screening What Trump said on March 13: \"Google is helping to develop a website. It's going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location ... Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now. They've made tremendous progress.\" The reality: Just hours after Trump claimed that Google was building a website to help Americans determine whether they need to be tested and then direct them to the closest testing site, Google issued a statement saying this was not true. Instead, a pilot website only for California was developed by Verily, a company owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet. The website, Project Baseline, is now only available to people who live in five counties in California. At the same time, health-insurance company Oscar Health, which is closely tied to Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, built a website designed to do what Trump promised the Google site would do. Kushner's brother, Josh Kushner, is a co-founder and investor in Oscar, which prompted legal experts to point out that the project might violate ethics laws. The Oscar project was later shut down.  No new oil for the US strategic reserve What Trump said on March 13: \"Based on the price of oil, I've also instructed the Secretary of Energy to purchase, at a very good price, large quantities of crude oil for storage in the U.S. Strategic Reserve. We're going to fill it right up to the top, saving the American taxpayer billions and billions of dollars, helping our oil industry.\" The reality: Congress is required to sign off on government funding to purchase crude oil, and it has refused to do so.

    "[] New York (AFP) - Donald Trump a affirmé lundi que les principaux pays exportateurs de pétrole prévoyaient une baisse de leur production deux fois plus importante que celle annoncée la veille par l'Opep et ses principaux partenaires. \"Pour avoir été impliqué dans les négociations, et c'est le moins qu'on puisse dire, l'Opep\" envisage une coupe de 20 millions de barils par jour et non de 10 millions, comme il est généralement rapporté\", a tweeté le président américain lundi matin. Lors de son point de presse quotidien consacré à la pandémie de Covid-19, M. Trump a enfoncé le clou: \"il y a des gens qui disent 10 millions mais je pense que le nombre auquel on va arriver sera plus proche de 20 millions de barils par jour\". \"Cette action historique va aider près de 11 millions d'employés américains de l'industrie pétrolière et gazière\", a ajouté le président, qui vise sa réélection et est soumis à forte pression par les élus républicains des Etats producteurs. Il a remercié, avec profusion, le roi et le prince héritier d'Arabie saoudite ainsi que le président Poutine et le président mexicain pour avoir trouvé un accord. Les prédictions du locataire de la Maison Blanche n'ont pas franchement soutenu les cours lundi: si le baril londonien de Brent a progressé de 0,83% à 31,74 dollars, le WTI new-yorkais a en revanche reculé de 1,5% à 22,41 dollars. L'Organisation des pays exportateurs de pétrole (Opep) et ses principaux partenaires, réunis au sein de l'Opep\", se sont accordés dimanche sur une réduction de leur production de 9,7 millions de barils par jour (mbj) en mai et en juin. De juillet à décembre, la réduction sera de 7,7 mbj et de janvier prochain à avril 2022, 5,8 mbj seront retirés du marché. L'\"ajustement historique\" de la production, selon le secrétaire général de l'Opep Mohammed Barkindo, a pour but de soutenir les cours de l'or noir, frappés de plein fouet par la crise liée au coronavirus, les mesures de confinement et le net ralentissement du transport mondial ayant fait s'effondrer la consommation d'énergie. Pour Andy Lipow, de Lipow Oil Associates, le chiffre de 20 mbj avancé par Donald Trump relève cependant plus d'un objectif à atteindre que d'une réalité concrète. Selon l'expert, il n'est même pas certain que les coupes de 9,7 mbj soient respectées. \"Il reste énormément de questions concernant le nombre de barils qui vont être retirés du marché\", explique M. Lipow. \"Toute hausse des prix dans les prochains mois va encourager les producteurs à continuer de produire. C'est le dilemme auquel l'Opep doit faire face\", souligne-t-il. Peu avant les déclarations de Donald Trump, le ministre saoudien de l'Energie avait toutefois laissé entendre que son pays pourrait accepter des coupes supplémentaires lors de la prochaine réunion de l'Opep en juin. \"La souplesse et le pragmatisme nous permettront de continuer à faire plus si nécessaire\", a affirmé le prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, cité par l'agence Bloomberg. \"Il faudra observer comment la situation évolue au niveau de la demande, si la destruction se poursuit ou s'il y a une amélioration\", a-t-il précisé. - Dilemme texan - En plus d'une consommation mondiale en berne, le marché pétrolier a été plombé ces dernières semaines par l'opposition frontale entre l'Arabie saoudite et la Russie, les deux plus gros producteurs mondiaux derrière les Etats-Unis. En mars, Ryad et Moscou s'étaient lancés dans une guerre des prix et des parts de marché, après avoir échoué à s'entendre sur des quotas de production. La dégringolade des cours pétroliers a particulièrement nui aux producteurs américains de pétrole de schiste, pour qui il est difficile de dégager des bénéfices à des prix si bas. Selon Dan Pickering de Pickering Energy Partners, les coupes de l'Opep\" \"ne vont pas tirer d'affaire le secteur énergétique américain.\" La situation est telle que M. Trump a évoqué à plusieurs reprises une possible réduction des extractions américaines. Mais une telle décision n'est pas du ressort du pouvoir fédéral en raison des règles sur la concurrence et du libre marché aux Etats-Unis. Plusieurs observateurs ont suggéré un déclin \"naturel\" de la production au gré de la chute des cours du brut, qui a commencé à se refléter dans le dernier rapport hebdomadaire de l'Agence américaine d'information sur l'Energie (EIA). Le président américain avait aussi dit le mois dernier vouloir porter le niveau des réserves stratégiques de pétrole à son maximum. Pour sa part, le Texas, qui produit environ 40% du pétrole américain, peut décréter des coupes via son autorité de régulation, la Texas Railroad Commission (RRC), une décision qui demeure rarissime. A la veille d'une réunion de la RRC, l'un de ses responsables, Ryan Sitton, a indiqué lundi être ouvert à une telle option, mais a concédé avoir de nombreuses réserves, au rang desquelles \"l'idée que le gouvernement prenne le contrôle d'entreprises privées.\"",
    "[] WASHINGTON – Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is looking for his Joe Biden. The former vice president, who has committed to having a woman on the presidential ticket, has begun the vetting process for a running mate after announcing his vice presidential selection committee on April 30. He has said he wants to make his pick before Aug. 1. Since he made that commitment to pick a woman as his running mate, several names have been floated, including some of his former Democratic opponents such as Sens. Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. (Klobuchar has since removed herself from consideration.) Biden is also facing fresh calls to choose a woman of color after following the death of George Floyd, which led to nationwide protests against police violence and systemic racism. The Democratic nominee has openly talked about some candidates he’s considering and said he has sought advice on the decision from former President Barack Obama. During a virtual fundraiser in April, Biden said Obama told him to find someone who has experience where the former vice president is lacking, a dynamic that worked well between the two. Biden noted he is looking for vice presidential candidate with whom he can be \"simpatico.\" More: Joe Biden tops Bernie Sanders to capture Wisconsin's Democratic presidential primary Here's a look at some of the women mentioned as possible running mates for Biden. All would be the first female vice president in U.S. history if Democrats win the White House in November. Abrams was the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Georgia in 2018. After losing that race by a fraction of the overall vote, she announced a nonprofit group called Fair Fight 2020, which staffs and funds voter protection teams in battleground states across the country. She is the former minority leader for the Georgia House of Representatives. Abrams initially said she wasn't interested in being a vice presidential candidate but said recently she would be “honored” to be considered Biden’s running mate. “I would be honored to be on the campaign trail as a running mate,” she told the podcast “Pod Save America,” hosted by former members of the Obama administration, last week. “But that is a process that you can’t campaign for, and I’m not campaigning for. I’m just being straightforward.” Want to talk more about politics? Join our Facebook group ‘Across the Aisle, Across the Nation.’ In March 2019, Biden met with Abrams before he announced he was running for president. Their meeting fueled speculation that the former vice president was going to jump into the race (which he did a month later) and that Abrams would be his running mate. Rumors were floated that Abrams herself was going to jump into the 2020 presidential primary. If chosen, she would be the first Black woman on a major party's presidential ticket. The senator from Wisconsin is the first openly gay person elected to the Senate and hails from a state Democrats need to win in November. Donald Trump narrowly won Wisconsin in 2016, and it is a battleground state that Republicans and Democrats have invested resources in. Biden was named the winner of the Democratic primary in Wisconsin, and a liberal judge knocked a conservative incumbent off the state Supreme Court, which has some Democrats optimistic about the party's chances in the general election. Baldwin has endorsed Biden. Baldwin has served as senator for the Badger State since 2012. She was reelected in 2018, winning by 11 points two years after Trump won the state. Baldwin was a member of Wisconsin's State Assembly and served in the U.S. House of Representatives for Wisconsin's 2nd Congressional District. Bass, 66, has served California's 37th congressional district, which represents Los Angeles, for five terms and endorsed Biden for president in mid-March. She is the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and is being vetted by the campaign, according to several news reports. House Majority Whip James Clyburn, whose endorsement helped revive Biden's campaign, had previously floated Bass to be considered as Biden's running mate. \"Karen Bass would be a big plus,\" Clyburn told CNN earlier this month. \"She is a great person in my mind, I work with her every day.\" Prior to being elected to Congress, Bass served in the California State Assembly. She made history in 2008 after being elected as the Speaker of the California State Assembly, where she became the first Black woman in United States history to serve as a Speaker of a state legislative body If selected, Bass would be the first Black woman on a major party's presidential ticket. Bottoms endorsed Biden in the early stages of the primary election, and has been serving as a key surrogate for his campaign since June 2019. If chosen, she would be the first Black woman on a major party's presidential ticket. Atlanta’s 60th mayor, and only the second Black woman to serve in that role, Lance Bottoms emerged as a leading figure on Biden's short list amid nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd and Rayshard Brooks. 'She has found her voice': Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms steps into national spotlight amid policing debate Floyd was a Black man died after after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes Nearly three weeks after his death, Rayshard Brooks was shot outside an Atlanta Wendy's after officers responded to a call about a man being asleep in his car in the drive-through lane. Bottoms, 50, moved quickly to fire the police officer who shot Brooks, and the incident led to the resignation of Police Chief Erika Shields, a Bottoms ally who will remain in the department. Demings, a two-term member of Congress, told The Washington Post last month “it’s such an honor” that her name has been mentioned as a possible vice president pick. Before being elected to Congress in 2016, Demings was chief of the Orlando Police Department, the first woman to hold the position. If chosen, she would be the first black woman on a major party's presidential ticket. Biden this month told a local ABC affiliate in Florida that Demings is \"one of a group of close to a dozen really qualified and talented women who are on the list.\" “She is a very competent, very capable person,\" Biden said of Demings. Demings, who helped lead the House impeachment efforts against Trump, also hails from a swing state: Florida. Trump won that state in 2016, and Republicans down the ballot were again successful in the 2018 midterms. Black voters, particularly women, have been a crucial part of Biden’s success and a crucial group in Democratic politics for years. “I grew up the daughter of a maid and a janitor. I grew up poor, black and female in the South, someone who was told a lot of times that I wasn’t the right color or gender. But my mother pushed me and said, ‘No, you can make it. If you work hard and play by the rules, you can be anything you wanna be and do anything you wanna do,’ ” Demings told the Post. “So the fact that my name is being called in such a special way for such an important position during such a critical time, it’s such an honor.” More: Bernie Sanders officially endorses Joe Biden for president Duckworth, a senator from Illinois, is a veteran who lost both her legs in Iraq, a Purple Heart recipient and the first woman with a disability to be elected to Congress. In 2018, she made history as the first senator to give birth while in office. Duckworth has called Trump a “draft dodger” and slammed him for \"using his privilege\" to defer military service. Before being elected to Congress, Duckworth was assistant secretary for public and intergovernmental affairs in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and was the director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. Duckworth is the daughter of a Thai mother of Chinese descent and would be the first Asian American woman on a major party's presidential ticket. Despite their viral clash at a debate early on in the presidential campaign, Biden hasn’t squelched speculation that Harris could end up on the Democratic ticket. “I’m so lucky to have you be a part of this partnership going forward. Working together, we can make a great deal of progress,” he told Harris at a virtual fundraiser last week after she introduced him. “I’m coming for you, kid.” Harris is emerging as a favorite among Biden aides, top donors and surrogates, according to a report from Politico. South Carolina Democrat Bakari Sellers, who was a top surrogate for Harris, told Politico that Harris \"deserves to be chosen.\" He added that “a lot of people are pushing for her. She has a lot of support.” Biden previously said “of course” he would consider Harris as a running mate. \"Sen. Harris has the capacity to be anything she wants to be. I mean it sincerely,\" Biden said in December shortly after Harris dropped out of the primary. \"She is solid. She can be president someday herself. She can be the vice president. She can go on to be a Supreme Court justice. She can be an attorney general. I mean, she has enormous capability.\" Early last month, Harris endorsed Biden’s campaign before Super Tuesday, when he won 10 out of the 14 contests. \"I have decided that I am, with great enthusiasm, going to endorse Joe Biden for president of the United States,\" Harris said in a video statement. \"I believe in Joe. I really believe in him, and I have known him for a long time.” Before being elected to the Senate, Harris was California's first female attorney general. Before that, she was district attorney of San Francisco. If chosen, she would be the first black woman and first Asian American woman on a major party's presidential ticket. More: Former Senate staffer accuses Joe Biden of sexual assault The New Mexico governor is not one of the most well-known politicians on the list but has a long history in politics. Lujan Grisham, the only nonwhite female Democratic governor in the country, was elected governor in 2018. She spent six years as a congresswoman representing New Mexico and was the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for 2 years. Lujan Grisham is part of a prominent political family in New Mexico. Her uncle, Manuel Lujan Jr., served as secretary of the interior in the George H.W. Bush administration, and her grandfather, Eugene Lujan, was chief justice of the New Mexico Supreme Court. Lujan Grisham, who is Hispanic, could help Biden's outreach to Latino voters, a group that overwhelmingly supported Sanders in the primary. When asked on CNN Sunday about possibly being chosen for the ticket, Lujan Grisham said, “I want to be the governor of New Mexico,” then added, “I will do whatever it takes to support a Biden administration, and I’m looking forward to a federal administration that can do a national strategy in good times and in bad times.” If chosen, she would be the first Latina on a major party's presidential ticket. The national security adviser in the Obama administration, Rice would bring years of national security expertise to the ticket, as well as a past working-relationship with the former vice president. More: How Susan Rice rose to the heights of public service and President Obama's inner circle She also served as the assistant secretary of state for African affairs during President Bill Clinton's administration, as well as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Obama. Rice was included in the list of vice presidential possibilities Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C. gave to Biden, according to the Atlantic. Clyburn is a longtime friend of Biden's, serves as House Majority Whip, and is the highest-ranking African American in Congress. However, Rice also is a name well-known in Washington, being viewed by Republicans as a key-player in the attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi where Americans were killed. Additionally, allies of Trump have seized upon newly declassified portions of an email written by Rice as evidence that an investigation into her incoming successor, Michael Flynn, was politically motivated. Poll: Joe Biden leads Donald Trump by 8 points Warren, who endorsed Biden Wednesday morning, could help with Biden’s unity pitch to the Democratic Party. She ran as a liberal and maintains some of her support among Democratic voters, while Biden touted more moderate policies. Nearly three out of four — 71% — of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters said Biden should consider Warren, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll released in early May. Harris followed at 59%, then Abrams at 50%, according to that CBS News/YouGov poll. More: More than 100 liberal activists urge Joe Biden to pick Elizabeth Warren as VP in letter Before being elected to the Senate in 2012, Warren was a Harvard law professor and led the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under President Barack Obama. She was the first female senator to be elected from Massachusetts. Biden has publicly said that the Michigan governor is on his short list. Whitmer has found herself in the national spotlight lately after the backlash she’s gotten from Trump over her criticisms of the administration’s coronavirus response. Biden, who endorsed Whitmer for governor in 2018, has repeatedly praised Whitmer and how she has handled the coronavirus pandemic in her state. She appeared on stage with him before the Michigan primary in March, along with Harris and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. Last week, Whitmer joined Biden on his podcast. Whitmer has previously said she would not be Biden’s running mate. \"I'm going to help him vet and make sure he's got a great running mate. It is not going to be me,\" she told MSNBC last month. \"But I'm going to have a hand in helping make sure that he has got the rounded out ticket that can win.” The senator from Minnesota exceeded expectations by placing third in the New Hampshire Democratic primary and gained some traction after her debate performances. She dropped out of the Democratic race before Super Tuesday and endorsed Biden the same day. Since then, Klobuchar has campaigned for Biden, and has been someone considered to be on the shortlist for running mate choices. But Klobuchar on June 18 said she was removing her name from consideration to be vice president and urging Biden to instead select a woman of color. 'I think this is a moment to put a woman of color on that ticket': Amy Klobuchar withdraws from vice president consideration \"I think this is a moment to put a woman of color on that ticket,\" Klobuchar said on MSNBC. \"If you want to heal this nation right now – my party, yes, but our nation – this is sure a hell of a way to do it.\" Biden reportedly had said the senator from Nevada was in his “top 3” as a running mate, but Cortez Mastio said in late May she was taking herself out of the running. “It is an honor to be considered as a potential running mate, but I have decided to withdraw my name from consideration,\" she said in a statement. “Nevada's economy is one of the hardest hit by the current crisis and I will continue to focus on getting Nevadans the support they need to get back on their feet.\" According to Mediate, Biden had discussed Cortez Masto as a possible pick with former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who vouched for the senator. Cortez Masto, the first Latina U.S. senator, could have helped Biden garner support with Latino voters who have been skeptical of his candidac. She was first elected to the Senate in 2016. Before that, she was the Nevada attorney general. If chosen, Cortez Masto would have been the first Latina on a major party's presidential ticket.

    "[] President Trump on Saturday defended the mounting series of protests against coronavirus restrictions, saying some governors had overreached in their efforts to fight the pandemic — efforts that were based on the advice of leading health officials in his own administration. \"I really believe that they're being unreasonable,\" Trump said, citing the Democratic governors of Michigan and Virginia. \"There are a lot of protests out there. And I just think that some of the governors have gotten carried away.\" Trump faulted Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for following closure and social-distancing guidance that came from his administration, and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam for gun-control measures he signed more than a week ago that have nothing to do with the coronavirus. Trump spoke hours after protests took place in Texas, Maryland, Indiana, Nevada and Wisconsin against ongoing stay-at-home restrictions enacted to fight the spread of the coronavirus. Several such demonstrations have already taken place across the country in recent days, including in California, Michigan, Ohio and New Jersey. On Saturday in downtown Annapolis, Md., dozens in their vehicles drove in circles and honked during a lunchtime protest. One woman waved a sign out her window that said, “I want to save my business!!! I need to work!” Another man scrawled on his pickup truck, “The face mask you were duped into wearing symbolizes you loosing your freedom of speech.” Outside the Texas Statehouse in Austin, protesters chanted, \"Fire Fauci!\" referring to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert who is widely credited with influencing President Trump's approach to the coronavirus pandemic. Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones made an appearance. More demonstrations are scheduled for the upcoming week, including a \"drive-in\" protest in Wisconsin that is being planned by TV commentator Stephen Moore, who is on Trump's task force charged with helping reopen the nation's economy. He has repeatedly compared coronavirus restriction protesters to civil rights icon Rosa Parks. “I call these people the modern-day Rosa Parks — they are protesting against injustice and a loss of liberties,” Moore told the Washington Post earlier in the week. Asked about the comparison, Trump replied, \"There is a lot of injustice.\" \"I could see where he's coming from. I think it's a strong statement, strong statement because hopefully this will be over very soon for all of us.\" The protests come when governors are weighing measures for reopening their economies without easing restrictions so quickly that they risk a new surge of infections, and without adequate testing capability. On Friday, Florida allowed some beaches to reopen — resulting in throngs crowding Jacksonville shorelines not wearing masks or practicing social distancing. Texas announced plans to ease some restrictions in coming days. Trump, after claiming sole authority over such matters and later reversing course and saying he was leaving such decisions up to the states, seemed to encourage protests Friday when he took to Twitter and wrote \"LIBERATE\" three states led by Democratic governors. Protests have already taken place in the states — Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia — and Trump later defended the protesters. “These are people expressing their views ... they seem to be very responsible people to me,” Trump said during his evening White House briefing Friday when asked whether he was worried that the gatherings could further spread the deadly virus. National polls indicate that the protesters do not reflect most Americans’ views. A Pew poll released Thursday found that 66% of Americans were concerned about lifting restrictions too quickly; 32% were concerned that they were not being lifted quickly enough. And some officials were increasing or extending restrictions Saturday. Hawaii's governor ordered all the state's beaches closed except for swimming and other socially distanced water activities. The Navajo Nation, the Native American tribe hardest hit by the coronavirus, ordered all people in public to wear masks on its reservation, which includes portions of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Florida announced school would be closed for the remainder of the academic year. More than 37,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the United States, with more than a third of the victims in New York state. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo made an impassioned plea Saturday for the nation to remain united as it fights the pandemic. “The emotion in this country is as high as I can recall, people are frustrated, we're anxious, we're scared, we're angry,” Cuomo said during his daily briefing, emphasizing that the crisis is mentally and economically devastating. “Look, if you have partisan divisions splitting this nation now, it's going to make it worse. … This is no time, and no place for division. We have our hands full as it is. Let's just stay together, and let's work it through.” Cuomo reported 540 new deaths Saturday morning, the lowest toll in several days. He also said that hospitalizations and intubations had declined. But he warned that 2,000 new cases are still being diagnosed or resulting in hospitalization daily, and that his state lacks the ability to do the type of widespread testing and tracking necessary for its economy to fully reopen. Cuomo repeated his plea for aid from the federal government, but did not lace into Trump as he did the previous day. “Nobody wants to reopen more than me. Nobody wants to get the economy going more than me. Nobody wants to get on with life more than me,” he said Saturday. “The tension on reopening is how fast can you reopen and what can you reopen without raising that infection rate so you go right back to where we were.”",
    "[] I  am not very much worried about President Donald Trump’s tweet-bombing the U.S. immigration system, even though it could conceivably affect my family. (Nefarious . . . Canadians!) I am pretty sure I have seen this movie before. Here is how it goes: President Trump finds himself mired in something that he isn’t very good at (governing, administration, being president, etc.) and as he gets bored and begins to lose the political fight, he makes some kind of dramatic proposal, invariably via Twitter, and the politico-media world is, for a day or two or three, convulsed. Trump’s team convenes and tries to figure out some kind of at least barely plausible legal or constitutional rationale for what the president has proposed, and then begins developing the policy he already has announced. Somebody you know from Fox News will go on television and say this has been under careful consideration for months and that all the top people have been working around the clock on it, and other people you know from Fox News will pretend to believe that. And then the drama starts to unravel. The big idea turns out to have a lot of qualifiers. In this case, that means things such as exempting “guest workers” from the purported ban, irritating my friend Mark Krikorian (of the Mayflower Krikorians) and other anti-immigration activists. Many other exemptions are under consideration as well, legal questions remain unresolved, and the Trump administration probably will end up putting six months of work into its 60-day moratorium, the principal effect of which, if it actually comes to pass, will be a larger backlog in green-card processing. The story repeats itself: Trump announces a prohibition on travel from China in response to the coronavirus, and more than 40,000 people (and counting) fly here from China while the conversation changes to whether we call this virus from Wuhan the Wuhan virus. Trump demands a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” but his administration ends up continuing to hand out thousands of visas to nationals of the targeted countries: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, etc. Trump promised to deport every single illegal immigrant residing in the United States and, if necessary, to create a special federal force to do that. That hasn’t happened, though the estimates suggest that the number of illegals in the United States has declined — as it has been declining since 2005. Build the wall, and make Mexico pay for it, etc. The situation of illegal immigrants is worth considering. I do not think it is very likely that some poor bum from Decatur ended up on Skid Row because he lost a spot in the computer-science Ph.D. program at Stanford to an Indian national and couldn’t endure the thought of going to Cornell instead. But some workers on the raggedy edge of solvency do compete head-to-head with illegals. Contrary to the popular impression, illegals are not concentrated in agriculture (only about 4 percent of illegals work in farming, and the vast majority of farm workers are not illegals) but instead are spread out through construction, hospitality, and services, especially in positions such as housekeepers, drywall installers, landscapers, dry cleaners, car washers, manicurists, and similar positions. But there is no industry or job in which illegals make up the majority of workers. The neo-Malthusian view that there are not enough jobs to go around is mistaken (people are assets, not liabilities, and jobs are a means, not an end), but if you were to take that view seriously, then it would make a lot of sense to prioritize illegals — which is, of course, what Trump and other immigration hawks have been telling us they want to do. Illegals by some estimates make up as much as 5 percent of the total work force, and, to the extent that they compete with U.S. citizens in the labor market, they often are competing mostly with workers whose next-best option is not very good. In this, they are different many legal immigrants: The guy who was runner-up to Hyderabad-born Satya Nadella for the top job at Microsoft is probably still doing okay in life. Only a couple of months ago, President Trump was saying he wants more immigrants — not just more, but radically more, immigrants in “the largest numbers ever.” In early April he proposed expanding the number of temporary workers admitted to the United States. “Reprehensible,” Mark Krikorian said. The administration has been all over the map when it comes to legal immigrants. And illegals, too. There are reasons to be concerned about illegal immigrants beyond the labor market, of course. Trump as a candidate made a big stink about illegal immigrants and violent crime, but his administration has not done a thing about that, and we still have illegals belonging to Central American gangs carrying out murders in American cities. Illegals are also themselves more vulnerable and likely to be victimized in various ways. And, of course, seeing to it that the laws on the books are actually enforced should be a norm. We write them down for a reason. So why is the Trump administration sitting on its hands when it comes to illegals but assertive when it comes to legal immigrants and would-be legal immigrants? The answer is: For the same reason the gun-grabbers concentrate their efforts on federally licensed firearms dealers and the people who do business with them — the nation’s least-criminal demographic — rather than prosecuting real-life straw-buyer cases or making sure that offenders do real time for weapons charges. It is pretty easy to police law-abiding people who are voluntarily submitting themselves to a legal process (whether that is immigration or buying a gun), filing paperwork, and undergoing background checks. Chasing actual lawbreakers around? That’s work. Changing the law is work, too — signing an executive order is pretty easy. But it is not much of a policy strategy. The Trump administration has not even managed to secure such elementary reforms as mandating the use of E-Verify or a similar system to cut off the main lure of illegal immigration at the source. Even when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress, President Trump could not be bothered to negotiate even a modest legislative package on his signature issue. But he can write his name on an executive order that may inconvenience a few thousand people who are attempting to lawfully follow the legal immigration process for a few months. Some of them may wonder why they didn’t just go the illegal route, which might have been easier. Maybe when the president is done with that, he can find a couple of grad students to bully. There’s an election coming up, after all. Editor’s Note: Due to an editing error, this article originally claimed 430,000 people had traveled to the U.S. from China since travel restrictions were imposed.

    "[] Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.) on Tuesday said she supported Joe Biden following former Biden staffer Tara Reade’s allegations that the presidential candidate sexually assaulted her. “I stand by [former] vice president Biden,” Gillibrand said in response to a question from JustTheNews during a conference call with reporters. “He’s devoted his life to supporting women and he has vehemently denied this allegation.” Gillibrand in 2018 was one of the most vocal defenders of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault during Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings. The New York senator argued that Ford should not be compelled to testify at the hearings without the benefit of witnesses and an investigation. “Without the benefit of an FBI investigation … and without the benefit of corroborating witnesses being able to testify, it’s a sham [confirmation] hearing,” Gillibrand said at the time. Reade in March accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in the spring of 1993, when she worked in his former Senate office. On Monday, a former neighbor of Reade’s told Business Insider that she described the assault in 1995. Reade has also said that her mother had made an anonymous call to CNN’s Larry King during an episode of Larry King Live to discuss the matter. A transcript of the call was obtained by The Intercept. Biden’s presidential campaign has vehemently denied Reade’s allegations. Biden has yet to personally respond to the allegations, and did not address the issue directly during a virtual town hall on women’s issues on Tuesday with failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

    "[] WASHINGTON – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi staunchly defended former vice president Joe Biden as \"a person of great integrity\" amid sexual assault allegations from a former female staffer that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee denies. While saying that Biden's accuser would have \"due process,\" Pelosi said the decades-old charge did not dampen her full-throated endorsement of Biden's candidacy. \"The happiest day for me this week was to support Joe Biden for president of the United States,\" she told reporters at a Thursday news conference on Capitol Hill after she was asked about the allegation. \"He's a person of great integrity, great concern for the American people.\" The accusation: Former staffer Tara Reade says Joe Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993. Here's what we know. Pelosi went on to say that \"there was never any record and nobody ever came forward to say something about it apart from the principal involved.\" Tara Reade, a former staffer to Biden when he served in the Senate, has accused the former Delaware lawmaker of sexually assaulting her in a Capitol Hill office building in 1993. Reade worked for Biden's Senate office at the time. Biden's campaign has adamantly denied the allegation, though Biden has not directly addressed the allegation yet. The accusation has opened a rift in Biden's left-wing support at a time when he's working to win over reluctant voters in his bid to defeat President Donald Trump in November. A number of Bernie Sanders' backers have said the allegations should prompt the former vice president to drop out of the race. But Pelosi's defense means the federal government's most powerful woman and a champion of the me-too movement remains firmly behind Biden, who has been criticized over the years for his manner of hugging and touching women. Reade's accusation is the first known allegation of sexual assault against Biden. \"So I want to remove all doubt in anyone's mind, I have great comfort level with the situation as I see it, with all the respect in the world for any woman who comes forward, but with all the highest regard for Joe Biden,\" Pelosi said. Sharing allegation: Report: Biden accuser spoke to neighbor about alleged assault The speaker issued a similar defense in a CNN interview Thursday morning. \"Well, I have great sympathy for any women who bring forth an allegation,\" the Speaker said on CNN's \"New Day.\" \"I'm a big, strong supporter of the 'me-too' movement. I think it has been a great — made a great contribution to our country. And I do support Joe Biden. I'm satisfied with how he has responded.\" When asked if Biden should directly address the allegation, Pelosi said, \"It's a matter that he has to deal with.\" This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Biden Tara Reade accusation: Nancy Pelosi defends ex-vice president",
    "[] In six months, voters go to the polls — unless they've mailed in their ballot — to pick a president. It's a national exercise that, practically speaking, consists of separate contests in 50 states and the District of Columbia. As 2016 reminded many Americans, the White House is awarded not to the candidate who wins the popular vote but the one who garners the most support in the electoral college. There are 538 electoral votes awarded on the basis of those individual contests; it takes 270 to win the presidency. Not every state is competitive. Some will vote for President Trump and others for former Vice President Joe Biden, no matter what happens between now and Nov. 3 That gives each candidate more than 200 electoral votes they can almost certainly count on. The balance are distributed across a dozen or so remaining states. Unless the race breaks strongly one way or the other, six of them will probably decide who sits in the White House starting Jan. 20, 2021. Here's a look at those key contests, with experienced political operatives in each state — one Democrat, one Republican — offering their thoughts on what it will take to win there in November: ARIZONA (11 electoral votes) 2016 result: Donald Trump 48.7%, Hillary Clinton 45.1% Since 1948, Bill Clinton is the only Democratic presidential hopeful to carry Arizona. Seeking reelection in 1996, he eked out his win with just 47% support. But Arizona has been thoroughly transformed since then. The changes that helped turn Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada from Republican redoubts to blue-tilting bastions — a growing and energized Latino voting population, an influx of newcomers from more liberal environs such as California — have also been taking place in Arizona. In addition, Trump faces the risk of serious defections among female voters in the electorally crucial Phoenix suburbs. The question is whether Biden can overcome Arizona's long-standing skepticism toward Washington and its ilk, which runs particularly strong among rural voters. Democrat Stacy Pearson: “For Joe Biden to win Arizona he needs to follow a centrist playbook. He has to understand that an Arizona independent is likely a recovering Republican libertarian who does not appreciate the Donald Trump effect.\" Republican Chuck Coughlin: “President Trump needs to convince the Arizona electorate that a Biden presidency will be [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi and [Democratic Senate Leader] Chuck Schumer's dream ... [that] they will change tax policy and change the culture of America in a very European progressive way and they're far too risky to our country's future.\" FLORIDA (29 electoral votes) Trump 49%, Clinton 47.8% No state balances on a knife's edge like Florida, the most populous and consistently competitive of the nation's battleground states. One reason may be the way Florida reflects the country at large. Parts of it are small-town rural, parts of it cosmopolitan. It's a little bit Southern and a little bit Caribbean. Since 1964, the state has gone with the winner in every presidential campaign save for 1992, when it backed incumbent George H.W. Bush over Bill Clinton. Demographic trends that could help Democrats in November, such as the growing black and Latino populations, are offset by trends that help Republicans, such as the influx of older, conservative white retirees. Florida would seem a must-win for Trump, who has changed his official residence from Manhattan to the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. The GOP, which holds the governorship and, after 2018, both U.S. Senate seats, has spent nonstop years on the ground honing its turnout operation, which may give the president a boost. Democrat Steve Schale: \"To win, Joe Biden needs to continue to do well in communities of color, run up large margins in the urban areas, and do well with retired voters who live along the I-4 corridor\" between St. Petersburg and Daytona Beach. Republican Brett Doster: \"There's no one key thing, but if you could boil it down to just a few absolutely necessaries, President Trump needs to get his share of the Puerto Rican vote and has got to have a dominant, dominant turnout in southwest Florida and the Panhandle.\" MICHIGAN (16 electoral votes) Trump 47.5%, Clinton 47.3% Trump took the White House by shattering the so-called blue wall, a cluster of industrial states — including Michigan — that had seemed reliably Democratic. He won the state, which last voted Republican in 1988, by less than 11,000 votes out of more than 4.5 million cast. Both sides see the Wolverine State as the likeliest of the top battlegrounds to flip in November. The state's popular Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, is being mentioned as a possible Biden running mate, which could further enhance his prospects. One key will be the shape of the auto business, Michigan's leading industry, come the fall. President Obama got a boost in his 2012 reelection bid from the lifeline Washington extended to Detroit during the Great Recession. As Obama's vice president, Biden hopes for some residual goodwill. There's an added wrinkle: the possible candidacy of Rep. Justin Amash of Grand Rapids, a Republican-turned-independent, who could attract support in and around his congressional district, though it's unclear which major party candidate that might hurt or help. Democrat Jill Alper: “Joe Biden needs to successfully prosecute the argument that he’ll eliminate the chaos and unify the country, building upon his Michigan-specific credentials of helping to lead the auto rescue and successfully guide Detroit through bankruptcy.\" Republican Rusty Hills: “President Trump has got to hold on to white working-class voters and then possibly dig a little bit deeper and amplify that vote 3, 4, 5%. Also, he needs to limit the loss among suburban women.” NORTH CAROLINA (15 electoral votes) Trump 49.8%, Clinton 46.2% When Obama carried North Carolina in 2008 — 49.7% to 49.4% over John McCain — he became the first Democrat to win the Tar Heel state since Jimmy Carter in 1976. In the next two elections, the state reverted to Republican form, but not by much. North Carolina has been one of the fastest growing states in the country. Few better embody the chasm between the cities and suburbs, which are filled in North Carolina with Democratic-leaning college graduates working in the financial and high-tech industries, and the sprawling rural and exurban areas, which remain strongly Republican. Partisan passions run deep; the state has a history in recent decades of acrimonious, closely fought contests, not just for the White House but also for U.S. Senate and, in 2016, the governor's office. A robust black turnout is crucial for Biden's success. In 2016, the African American vote fell from 2008 and 2012 levels, when Obama was running, and that helped contribute to Hillary Clinton's loss. Democrat Gary Pearce: “Joe Biden needs to offer a sensible, reasonable alternative to Donald Trump.\" Republican Carter Wrenn: \"President Trump needs to whip coronavirus and get out his vote.\" PENNSYLVANIA (20 electoral votes) Trump 48.2%, Clinton 47.5% Trump became the first Republican since George H.W. Bush in 1988 to carry the state, the second chunk of the supposed blue wall to cave in on Democrats. Hillary Clinton managed to win Philadelphia's socially moderate, increasingly Democratic suburbs by an even bigger margin than Obama. But Trump enjoyed strong support in Rust Belt communities, carrying counties such as Luzerne and Erie that once were Democratic strongholds. Republicans hope to make energy an issue in a state that is a major natural gas producer, saying Biden's stance on environmental issues and alternative fuels would eliminate sorely needed jobs. But the former vice president enjoys one advantage Clinton lacked: He was born in blue-collar Scranton and spent more than three decades representing neighboring Delaware in the Senate, so there is a familiarity that could help blunt Trump's attacks. His strong support among seniors could also help in a state with one of the oldest populations in the country. Democrat Joe Shafer: “Joe Biden needs to continue the trend toward Democrats in the suburbs, running up the score, while making moderate progress from Clinton's numbers in counties that moved toward Trump, like Erie, Luzerne and Northampton.\" Republican Charlie Gerow: “The Trump campaign will need to laser-focus on registration and getting to the polls voters that lean his way but did not vote in 2016 for some reason.” WISCONSIN (10 electoral votes) Trump 47.2%, Clinton 46.5% Wisconsin was the third portion of the blue wall to crumble, voting Republican for the first time since President Reagan's 1984 landslide reelection. Trump won in good part due to strong support in Wisconsin's abundant small towns and rural areas, and a falloff in Democratic balloting in the state's most populous city, Milwaukee. He also benefited from a sizable defection of Obama voters, many of them blue-collar workers, who shunned Hillary Clinton. Democrats were heartened by turnout in last month's election, run amid the pandemic, when a liberal challenger nabbed a state Supreme Court seat held by a conservative justice. The contest was just the latest skirmish in more than a decade's worth of ruthless, all-out, partisan warfare. Both sides agree the results in November are likely to be very close, in keeping with several presidential contests going back to 2000. Clinton all but ignored the state four years ago — she never set foot in Wisconsin after losing the April primary to Bernie Sanders — until it was too late. Biden is not likely to make that same mistake. Democrat Mike Tate: \"Joe Biden, in addition to having a robust turnout in urban areas, in particular Milwaukee, has got to compete and win votes in [suburban] Waukesha County and get the votes of blue-collar, high school-educated voters in Green Bay and the Fox Valley.\" Republican Brian Reisinger: “President Trump needs to tell a story of how he shook up the system and got results. This needs to be a campaign about his record getting the economy on a strong track, rebuilding our military and restoring some of the greatness people remember in Wisconsin and other parts of the country when they were kids and proud of our country.\"",
    "[] WASHINGTON — The Trump administration’s nominee for inspector general overseeing billions in Treasury Department coronavirus relief funds is facing skepticism from Democrats who fear that he will not show sufficient independence. Even so, that nominee, Brian D. Miller, stands to be confirmed as the special inspector general for pandemic recovery by a Republican-controlled Senate. In that position, he would monitor the disbursement of $500 billion in loans to businesses and corporations. Those funds were appropriated in last month’s CARES Act, a $2 trillion package meant to stimulate an economy paralyzed by the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic skepticism during the hearing of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, came in part because Miller currently serves as a White House attorney. Miller fought back by citing his legal mandate to investigate fraud and abuse related to coronavirus spending. “If I am unable to do my job, I will resign,” he vowed. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., asked if he would look to “gain presidential approval before investigating contacts, issuing reports or communicating with Congress.” Miller promised that he would not. His supporters on the Republican side pointed to an investigation Miller did as an inspector general in the George W. Bush administration, when he faulted top federal administrator Lurita Doan for abusing her position. Doan, who had been a military contractor before joining the Republican administration, was forced to resign. Most recently, his job was to defend Trump on charges related to abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. During the impeachment inquiry into President Trump’s withholding of military aid to Ukraine, Miller rebuffed a request from the Government Accountability Office. “The White House does not plan to respond separately to your letters,” Miller wrote on Dec. 20 of last year. The impeachment has receded in the national imagination, overtaken by a pathogen that has killed some 70,000 Americans. Still, Miller’s rejection of the information request returned as a point of contention on Tuesday, as Democrats wondered if he could ever assert independence from a president he has been representing. “I was just answering the mail,” Miller explained of that exchange. Democrats were not satisfied with that answer, with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., wondering if Miller would find such “stonewalling,” as he called it, “acceptable” in response to a coronavirus-related inquiry. “I’m not really sure what your question is getting at,” Miller replied. A former attorney in the George W. Bush administration who later served as inspector general for the General Services Administration — the position in which he wrote the report critical of Bush appointee Doan — Miller gave careful, legalistic answers, vowing to assert his own independence but avoiding any overt criticism of the Trump administration. “I will conduct every audit and investigation with fairness and impartiality,” he said in his opening statement, pledging to “seek the truth in all matters that come before me.” Those matters are likely to involve questions about why large, well-funded corporations are asking for small-business loans. And there have been reports of people connected to the White House seeking such loans. Given the president’s business ties, Democrats worry about the proliferation of such arrangements. The hearing took place under remarkable circumstances, two days into the Senate’s return to a capital that remains under lockdown. The upper chamber was hastened into reconvening by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., despite objections from some legislators that it was not safe to do so. His counterpart in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has not yet moved to reopen her chamber, though she may do so as early as next week. The familiar scene of a hearing room packed with legislative aides and members of the public was nowhere in evidence. Instead, large bottles of hand sanitizer and cylindrical containers of sanitizing wipes marked a new congressional normal. So did a briefing room largely absent of legislators themselves. Many attended the hearing via video. Those who attended in person wore face masks, as did the nominees themselves (along with Miller, the committee considered the nomination of Dana T. Wade to become the chairperson of the Federal Housing Administration). Miller’s nomination has been especially fraught because Trump has shown unrelenting suspicion of inspectors general, who are supposed to act as independent watchdogs within their agencies. Trump has routinely challenged that independence. Only last Friday, he removed Christi Grimm, inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, for a report that highlighted “severe shortages of testing supplies” in hospitals. Before that, he fired Glenn Fine, who had been overseeing all coronavirus spending. And right before that, he fired Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community’s inspector general, whose certification of a whistleblower complaint initiated the very impeachment investigation that Miller and other White House attorneys would be responding to months later. Democrats wondered if Miller had anything to do with the removal of Fine or Atkinson, but Miller said his “ethical obligations” prevented him from saying anything about his White House work. Early in the hearing, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, asked Miller if he would show support for Grimm, who had lost her job for writing the very kind of report Miller will be expected to conduct. “I am not here to assess those sort of actions,” Miller answered. He also survived an exchange with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who had previously indicated her unease with the Miller nomination. Under intense questioning from the progressive former presidential candidate — and potential vice presidential pick for Democratic nominee Joe Biden — Miller made concessions, somewhat uneasily, to her consumer watchdog side, asserting that companies that took loans but then still laid off or furloughed workers could earn unwelcome attention from him. “I’m not comfortable answering hypotheticals,” Miller said, right before agreeing that the first of the hypotheticals she presented would merit scrutiny from his office. “Good, good,” Warren said. She also asked him if a company that lobbied the White House and Congress receiving a bailout was a “potential circumstance” he would want to investigate. As the nominee hesitated, Warren reminded him that they had spoken privately the day before, and that he had then agreed that such a scenario was worthy of investigation. That left Miller with little option but to agree. The Republicans have a narrow majority in the Senate. It’s not clear that Democrats were willing to put much energy into the fight against the Miller nomination, in seeming awareness of the coronavirus-related battles all but certain to come. _____ Click here for the latest coronavirus news and updates.

    "[] Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) has a few new principles now that he's under the Senate's spotlight. Ratcliffe faced a Senate nomination hearing on Tuesday after President Trump nominated him, for the second time, to be the next director of national intelligence. In his hearing, Ratcliffe promised protections for whistleblowers and showed support for the intelligence community — a stark contrast from how he spoke about those topics in the past. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) on Tuesday asked Ratcliffe if he thought \"the intelligence agencies of the United States are running amok,\" which Ratcliffe answered with a blunt \"no.\" That's a change from the many times Ratcliffe has railed against intelligence agencies' alleged \"bias\" and \"prejudice\" toward Trump.

    "[] Outraged by allegations that Los Angeles sheriff's deputies shared photos from the site of a helicopter crash that killed Lakers star Kobe Bryant, his daughter and seven others, a California lawmaker wants to make it a crime for law enforcement officers to take unauthorized photographs of those killed in accidents and crimes. State Assemblyman Mike Gipson (D-Carson) has introduced legislation that would make it a misdemeanor with punishment of up to a year in jail and as much as $5,000 in fines for a first responder to use a smartphone or other device to photograph a deceased person for any purpose other than official law enforcement business. “Our first responders, when responding to an emergency, should not be taking very sensitive photographs … for their own gain, for their own pleasure,” Gipson said Tuesday. “It was unconscionable. It’s not right.” Assembly Bill 2655, which was introduced this week, would outlaw acts that violate the privacy of deceased victims and apply to all first responders acting under color of authority, including law enforcement officers, paramedics, dispatchers, firefighters and medical examiners. The bill would also allow a search warrant to be issued on grounds that the property being seized contains evidence that a first responder has taken unauthorized photographs at crime scenes and accidents in an invasion of privacy. Bryant was killed along with eight others, including his teenage daughter, when a helicopter taking them to a youth basketball tournament crashed in the hills of Calabasas on Jan. 26. Three days after the accident, a Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy was at a Norwalk bar and allegedly showed patrons some gruesome photos taken at the crash site. That resulted in a citizen complaint to the department. Sheriff Alex Villanueva later acknowledged that the department ordered deputies to delete the images, The Times reported. Amid public outrage, the department launched an investigation of the sharing of the photographs, and Villanueva asked his agency’s chief watchdog to monitor the inquiry. In addition, Villanueva asked the Sheriff Civilian Oversight Commission to provide input as his agency drafts a new policy regarding the taking and distribution of photographs and recordings by on-duty personnel. An attorney for Vanessa Bryant, the widow of Kobe Bryant and mother of Gianna Bryant, 13, who was also killed in the crash, called the alleged behavior by deputies “inexcusable and deplorable.”",
    "[] House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) announced the creation of a “China Task Force” to examine  “a wide range of China-related issues,” including the Chinese Communist Party’s role in allowing coronavirus to become a global pandemic. Speaking to reporters in a press conference on Thursday, McCarthy accused Democrats of backing away from “something that has long been a bipartisan consensus in Washington,” claiming that he had reached an agreement for a bipartisan committee in February, only for the Democrats to pull back at the last minute. “We cannot wait any longer, the stakes are too high to sit idly by, which is why today I am announcing the Republican-led China Task Force, and I invite the Democrats to join with us,” McCarthy stated. “There was one moment in time they said yes, a few months ago they said no, I’d say there’s no important time now to join with us together, to work as one nation, as we face these challenges.” The California Republican said the group would be composed of 15 Republicans representing 14 different committees of jurisdiction — “a microcosm of our entire conference.” Led by Representative Michael McCaul (R., Texas.), ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the committee includes Representatives Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.), Anthony Gonzalez (R., Ohio), Darin LaHood (R., Ill.), Mike Gallagher (R., Wisc.), Guy Reschenthaler (R., Pa.), Denver Riggleman (R., Va.), Elise Stefanik (R., N.Y.), John Curtis (R., Utah), Andy Barr (R., Ky.), John Joyce (R., Pa.), Adam Kinzinger (R., Ill.), Jim Banks (R., Ind.), Michael Waltz (R., Fla.), and Chris Stewart (R., Utah). Besides examining the CCP’s role in withholding early information, with a timeline showing officials withheld knowledge from the public about the virus’s transmissibility, the committee will also examine Chinese “influence” in American institutions, “economic threats,” and China’s  “efforts to gain the technological advantage.” “Not only do we have to hold the CCP accountable for their role in the spread of coronavirus, the United States must take bold action to address the CCP’s malign agenda and better compete with China on the world stage,” McCaul told the Washington Post, which first revealed the committee. “This is the number one issue not only today but for the future.” McCarthy concluded by saying the group would compile a “comprehensive report,” with recommendations for potential legislative action coming by October.

    "[] WASHINGTON – Honeywell officials declined to comment Thursday on President Donald Trump's assertion that he was exempted from wearing a mask during a tour of an Arizona face mask facility this week, saying only that people around him did not have to wear them. Honeywell also did not address Trump's claim that he actually wore one briefly. Trump drew fire Tuesday for not wearing a mask during a tour of the Arizona facility. The president claimed that he had worn a mask \"back stage\" before he walked into view of the cameras. He also said Honeywell's CEO told him he did not have to wear a mask. Reached by USA TODAY on Thursday, a Honeywell spokesman said it would not comment on Trump's actions or statements. A company statement said only that some people who were near the president were exempted while he met with workers at the facility because they had been tested for the virus. \"Following White House recommended protocol, a small number of individuals directly interfacing with the President on Tuesday were tested for COVID-19 immediately prior to the event, received negative test results, and were permitted to not wear masks during portions of the visit based on that medical screening,\" Honeywell said in a statement. Honeywell, which did not comment beyond its statement, added that \"all others present were wearing masks and social distancing in accordance with Honeywell’s site policy.\" More: White House considers future of task force and downplays predicted surge More: What we learned about Honeywell N95 mask production from Trump's visit Trump took criticism for not wearing a mask while touring the plant, just as Vice President Mike Pence did when he declined to wear a mask during a visit to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. Pence later said that he should have worn a mask, which is recommended – but not required – by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Speaking with reporters Wednesday at the White House, Trump said, \"I had a mask on for a period of time\" before the event. He also said he was told by a unnamed company official that he didn't need to wear a mask. \"I can't help it if you didn't see me,\" Trump said. \"I mean, I had a mask on, but I didn't need it. And I asked specifically the head of Honeywell, 'Should I wear a mask?' And he said, 'Well, you don't need one in this territory.'\" White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told reporters that Honeywell's CEO told the president that \"there was no need\" to wear a mask so Trump \"followed that.\" The president did wear goggles during the tour. Critics said Trump should have worn a mask anyway. \"Masking the truth, but never his mouth,\" tweeted U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas. Sen.

    "[] Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on Tuesday warned the Senate about the dangers of states reopening too quickly amid the coronavirus pandemic, saying this could result in more \"suffering and death.\" Fauci, a member of President Trump's coronavirus task force, remotely testified before the Senate on Tuesday and said that the \"consequences could be really serious\" if states reopen their economies too quickly without following the White House's guidelines, noting they must be capable to respond to an increase in infections. \"There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you may not be able to control, which in fact, paradoxically, will set you back, not only leading to some suffering and death that could be avoided, but could even set you back on the road to try to get economic recovery,\" Fauci said. \"It would almost turn the clock back rather than going forward.\" Many states have started to reopen their economies despite not meeting the White House's guidelines, which include that states should have a \"downward trajectory of positive tests\" or a \"downward trajectory of documented cases\" over two weeks. According to The New York Times, \"in more than half of states easing restrictions, case counts are trending upward, positive test results are rising, or both.\" As of Tuesday, 80,000 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported in the United States, but Fauci also told lawmakers during the hearing that this is probably an undercount. \"The number is likely higher,\" Fauci said. \"I don't know exactly what percent higher, but almost certainly it's higher.\"  Dr. Fauci warns that if states and cities disregard reopening checkpoints,”there is a real risk you will trigger an outbreak you might not be able to control ... leading to some suffering and death that could be avoided.” pic.twitter.com/CsLmxfHEzQ — NBC News (@NBCNews) May 12, 2020 More stories from theweek.com\nCoronavirus will win.

    "[] AP Photo/Patrick Semansky The Supreme Court began hearing oral arguments Tuesday in three highly anticipated cases centering around President Donald Trump's taxes and financial records. Two cases relate to subpoenas from congressional committees for Trump's financial records. The third relates to the Manhattan DA's office's subpoena for Trump's tax returns as it investigates if the Trump Organization broke state laws. In all three cases, lower courts rejected Trump's arguments and said the president has to turn over his records to congressional and New York state investigators. The Supreme Court is now Trump's last hope to stop the public from gaining access to his financial records. Scroll down for key updates from Tuesday's hearing. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. The Supreme Court wrapped up over three hours of oral arguments on Tuesday as attorneys for President Donald Trump, the Justice Department, Congress, and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office duked it out over Trump's long-held finances. In the first case, Trump's lawyers argued that subpoenas from three House committees for Trump's financial records do not serve a legitimate legislative purpose and are instead intended to harass the president. The House counsel countered that claim, saying that in addition to serving a future legislative purpose, there is a long history of presidents responding — either voluntarily or involuntarily — to congressional requests for information. The court's conservative majority — Justices John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh — were sharply skeptical of Congress' arguments and questioned whether allowing it to proceed would open the floodgates for additional subpoenas that could harass or distract the president. In the second case, centered around the Manhattan DA's subpoena for Trump's tax returns, the president's lawyer, Jay Sekulow, made a broad and unprecedented claim: that Trump is immune from any criminal investigation or prosecution while in office. Justices on both sides of the aisle were highly skeptical of Sekulow's argument and repeatedly asked him to elaborate on why Trump should be above the law, and why the court should differentiate between a civil proceeding — like Clinton v. Jones, in which the court ruled that Bill Clinton had to respond to Paula Jones' lawsuit — and a criminal proceeding. Carey Dunne, the general counsel for the Manhattan DA's office, highlighted the unprecedented nature of Sekulow's argument and said the president has \"responsibilities like every other citizen.\" He also argued that the office would have been \"remiss\" not to investigate Trump's taxes after public reports indicated that his company, which is headquartered in Manhattan, may have engaged in illegal activity. Overall, the justices asked questions that aligned with each of their respective ideological camps. But Roberts frequently questioned lawyers for both sides with equal scrutiny, making it tougher to gauge which way he'll ultimately rule on the cases. Tuesday's oral arguments began at 10 a.m. ET. Unlike earlier cases, they were conducted over the telephone, and the public was able to listen in. Currently, the court has a 5-4 conservative majority, and two of the justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, are Trump appointees. Scroll down for key updates from the hearings: Lawyer representing the Manhattan district attorney's office says Trump's lawsuit itself is giving him immunity from prosecutorial scrutiny Spencer Platt/Getty Images Carey Dunne, the general counsel for the Manhattan district attorney's office, told the court that the legal process surrounding this case has already set the investigation back months. Further delay could hurt the case even more if evidence disappears or witness memory fades. In some ways, he said, the delay itself has given Trump immunity from prosecutorial scrutiny. \"We've already lost nine months of time in this investigation due to this lawsuit,\" Dunne said. \"Every minute that goes by without even a decision on the merits here, is granting the kind of temporary absolute immunity that the president is seeking here.\" Moreover, \"no one should forget that we've got an investigation that is looking at the conduct of other people and businesses\" in additon to just Trump, \"and waiting like that would benefit those other participants. They could all end up above the law\" if statutes of limitation expire during the delay, Dunne said. If the court ultimately nullifies the Manhattan DA's subpoena, there is \"a risk that American presidents and third parties could unwittingly end up above the law.\" Manhattan DA's counsel: Presidents are not exempt from being criminally investigated and have 'responsibilities like every other citizen' Evan Vucci/AP Photo Carey Dunne, the general counsel for the Manhattan DA's office, emphasized during oral arguments that the subpoena imposes \"no Article II burden whatsoever\" and was not borne of any political animus or intent to harass. He added that the subpoena was prompted by \"public reports that certain business transactions in our jurisdiction were possibly illegal. Given those allegations, our office would have been remiss not to follow up.\" Dunne also said that in response to the subpoena, Trump sought to overturn 200 years of legal precedent by declaring himself immune from any investigative scrutiny, even for \"prior private acts.\" Trump also asked the court to presume that state actors have a \"reckless mania\" allowing them to harass the president, Dunne said. \"There is no historical support for this claim, which flies in the face of federalism. The supposed floodgates have been open for generations and there's never been a flood.\"  Justice Department distances itself from Trump counsel's 'temporary immunity' claim Cliff Owen/AP Solicitor General Noel Francisco represented the Justice Department in the New York case. Francisco did not lean on the same argument Sekulow did — that Trump has \"temporary immunity\" from criminal investigation or prosecution. He said that while the DOJ believes Sekulow made a \"strong argument\" on the matter, it doesn't believe that's an issue the court needs to address until the state prosecutor, in this case Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance, Jr., meets \"the special needs standard\" for the presidency. Francisco argued that there should be a heightened standard for state prosecutors for two reasons: State proceedings can pose a greater threat to the presidency, and federal courts should balance prosecutors' local need for information against national interests and those of the president. Ordinary grand jury rules are not designed to protect Article II interests, which relate to the executive branch and powers of the president. Sekulow: Trump 'is not to be treated as an ordinary citizen ... he is himself a branch of government' Associated Press \"The president is not to be treated as an ordinary citizen,\" Sekulow said. \"He has responsibilities — he is himself a branch of government. He is the only individual who is a branch of government in the federal system.\" Multiple justices on both the liberal and conservative sides of the court pushed back on Sekulow's argument. \"You are asking for broader immunity than anyone else gets,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor said at one point. \"He's the president of the United States. He is a branch of the federal government,\" Sekulow replied. \"The president isn't above the law,\" Justice Elena Kagan said later. Conservative justices are skeptical of the Trump team's claims Senate TV Chief Justice John Roberts — whose confirmation Sekulow helped push through in 2005 — and Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, raised questions about the president's argument in the New York case. Roberts asked Trump's counsel, Jay Sekulow, why this case is more distracting for the president than Clinton v. Jones, in which the court required then President Bill Clinton to respond to a sexual harassment lawsuit by a former Arkansas state employee, Paula Jones. \"I would have thought the discovery in a case like Clinton v. Jones would be similarly distracting.\" Gorsuch echoed that point. Sekulow responded that Clinton v. Jones was a civil case litigated in federal court, not a state investigation. Sekulow: Constitution grants Trump 'temporary presidential immunity' from any investigation or prosecution AP Photo/Steve Helber Sekulow opened his arguments with a bold claim. \"No county district attorney in our nation's history has issued criminal process against the sitting president of the United States, and for good reason: the Constitution does not allow it,\" he said. \"Temporary presidential immunity is constitutionally required by Article II, and accordingly, the supremacy clause defeats any authority the DA has under state law as to the president. The Second Circuit is wrong and should be reversed.\" If it isn't reversed, he added, the decision would \"weaponize\" every local district attorney and allow them to \"harass, distract, and interfere with the sitting president.\" After a short break, the Supreme Court began hearing arguments in the second case, involving the Manhattan DA's subpoena for Trump's tax returns Associated Press Jay Sekulow, Trump's longtime personal defense lawyer who represented him in the FBI's Russia investigation, argued for the president in this case. The Justice Department solicitor general, Noel Francisco, also argued on Trump's behalf. Justice Brett Kavanaugh asks whether the House can subpoena Trump's medical records Erin Schaff-Pool/Getty Images Kavanaugh, the newest justice appointed to the Supreme Court, asked the House counsel, Douglas Letter, whether Congress has the power to subpoena Trump's medical records. Letter said Trump's private medical records would likely be outside of the scope of Congress' power. Records from the president's doctors would most likely be irrelevant to any legislative purpose, and the House would have \"no valid reason\" to seek them, Letter added. Justice Samuel Alito says he's 'baffled' by House counsel's argument AP Photo/Stephan Savoia, File Alito said he was \"baffled\" by House counsel Douglas Letter's response to Justice Ginsburg about the use of congressional subpoenas to harass the president. Letter said at the time that the courts can intervene in such cases to settle the dispute. However, \"that's the issue here,\" Alito said. \"Whether something should be done to prevent the use of these subpoenas for the harassment of a president. Can you explain what you meant?\" Letter responded that the court has previously ruled that it will intervene to protect the president if he's facing harassment from Congress or private individuals. However, in this case, Letter said there is a \"valid legislative purpose\" that four lower courts upheld. Alito interjected and asked Letter to confirm that the main protection against usage of subpoenas for presidential harassment is \"simply the assessment whether the subpoena is conceivably is relevant to some conceivable legislative purpose.\" \"Correct,\" Letter said. \"That's not much protection,\" Alito countered. \"In fact, it's no protection.\" Letter disagreed, saying that it would be different if Congress was directly interfering with Trump's ability to do his job. However, the subpoenas at issue in this case are to private parties and have not requested anything of Trump directly. He later reiterated that argument to Justice Elena Kagan, who asked Letter about the Trump team's claim that the subpoenas hamper his ability to do his job. Letter said that there is a long history of presidents complying with congressional requests for information. \"There is no way this could interfere with the president because he doesn't have to do anything,\" Letter said. \"This was a subpoena to a bank and an accounting firm.\" Chief Justice John Roberts asks the House of Representatives' lawyer if there are any limits on Congress' power to seek information about the president Reuters/Jonathan Ernst When Douglas Letter, the counsel for the House of Representatives, began his arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts asked him about the limits of congressional power to seek information about the president. Letter said the power relates to anything that could have a legislative purpose. \"Your test is not really much of a test,\" Robert said. \"It's not really a limit. Do you have any alternative to that limitless test?\" Letter responded that Congress' power to investigate the president could be limited if it impedes his ability to govern. But he emphasized that the subpoenas in this case — issued to Trump's banks and accounting firm — are not requesting any action from Trump himself and therefore do not restrict his ability to carry out his duties. Justice Sotomayor points to Trump's business interests before he took office and asks why 'Congress can't believe that looking at longstanding relationships ... is important to knowing what undue influence might be occurring' Spencer Platt /Staff/Getty Images Sotomayor's line of questioning was a reminder that before being inaugurated in 2017, Trump was primarily a businessman. Notably, he hasn't divested his interests in the Trump brand and Trump Organization since taking office. His properties have also been at the center of several ethics lawsuits questioning whether Trump is profiting from the presidency by having high-ranking diplomats and US officials stay at his resorts and golf clubs and host events there. If Congress wants to look at Trump's business records, deputy solicitor general Jeffrey Wall said, \"it needs to do more than wave its hands about general purposes and saying that the president would be a useful case study about generally applicable laws.\" Sotomayor interjected, asking Wall to name any other setting in which an investigative body needs to do more to obtain private records than what Congress did in this case. Wall began noting that during the Watergate scandal, the special prosecutor had to show a specific need related to obtaining Richard Nixon's Oval Office tapes. \"I don't want you to go to executive privilege cases,\" Sotomayor said, cutting Wall off. \"They're not asking for these records post- being president, they're asking for these papers pre- being president.\" Wall responded that he believed that made the issue \"worse, not better\" because it relates to Trump's personal life before he was a candidate for office. Justice Breyer homes in on the central question in the case: is Trump above the law? Reuters Breyer conceded that it should be \"rare\" for the courts to weigh in on a tug-of-war between two powerful branches of the government. But when it does, he asked, why should the same standard that applies to every \"human being in the United States\" not apply to the president? Breyer pointed specifically to the court's decision in Clinton v. Jones, in which it opined on special circumstances applying to the president, his personal life, and the needs of his office. \"Would you object to a decision of this court that says apply that, taking into account the special needs of the presidency, just like other human beings sometimes have special needs?\" Breyer asked. Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall said he would object, because the subpoenas at issue in this case are different from those issued in Clinton v. Jones, which came from a prosecutor and were focused on exposing potential wrongdoing. In this case, Wall said, the subpoenas to Trump must pertain to a specific legislative purpose. He added that in Clinton v. Jones, the court rejected an absolute immunity argument but said the president was entitled to some special protections. \"We're here saying the court should take exactly the same approach,\" Wall said. \"We're not saying the House has no power to get at the records of a sitting president. We're saying that it needs to satisfy a heightened standard, because if it doesn't, these requests will become routine. And that weapon in the standing arsenal of the houses of Congress will, I think, be routinely deployed in a way that harms both the separation of powers and that undermines the presidency.\" Justice Department weighs in, warns House subpoenas are 'harassing, distracting, and undermining the president' REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst Jeffrey B. Wall, the deputy solicitor general appearing on behalf of the Justice Department, also urged the Supreme Court to strike down the House's subpoenas, saying their purpose was not legislative, but to \"expose wrongdoing.\" \"If you look at what they say about intended legislative proposals and why they need the documents, it's paper-thin,\" Wall said. He also echoed Patrick Strawbridge, Trump's personal defense lawyer on the case, in saying that the subpoenas pose a \"danger of harassing, distracting, and undermining the president.\" Trump lawyer emphasizes that Congress is not subpoenaing Trump in connection to a specific bill under consideration Associated Press Justice Brett Kavanaugh, another Trump appointee, also asked whether Congress has a legislative purpose in seeking Trump's records. In response to both Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, Trump's attorney, Patrick Strawbridge, said that unless Congress is subpoenaing Trump's financial records in connection to a specific bill under consideration, it does not have a right to obtain them. If it did, Strawbridge said, it would be \"a door that opens to endless subpoenas and harassment anytime one party controls one house of Congress opposite from the president.\" Justice Gorsuch grills Trump's lawyers on why the president should have the power to determine what constitutes a legitimate legislative purpose for Congress Associated Press/J. Scott Applewhite Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, kicked off his questioning by asking the president's lawyer, Patrick Strawbridge, why the House should not be allowed to determine on its own what amounts to a \"substantial legislative need\" when issuing subpoenas for documents and testimony. \"Why should we not defer to the House's views about its own legislative purposes?\" Gorsuch asked. Strawbridge responded that there are \"several reasons\" why, in the Trump team's view: The subpoena power \"is an implied power,\" and Congress cannot use its \"implied powers to challenge the structure of government,\" and the subpoenas are a \"challenge to the separation of powers.\" In previous cases involving disputes between the legislative and executive branches, the Supreme Court did not weigh in \"precisely because it was a battle between the branches.\" \"The president has his own powers that are created by the Constitution.\" In cases going back to Chief Justice John Marshall, the first chief justice of the Supreme Court, it was determined that \"we do not proceed against the president as we do against an ordinary litigant.\" Justice Elena Kagan: 'These subpoenas are for personal records, where the president is just a man. They're not for official records, where the president might have executive privilege' Mark Wilson/Getty Images Justice Kagan joined Justices Sotomayor and Breyer in pointing out that the congressional subpoenas for Trump's financial records are not related to his time as president but rather his personal life before he took office. Kagan also pointed back to Breyer's questioning and asked Patrick Strawbridge, Trump's defense lawyer, to justify why there should be a higher standard for obtaining the president's personal records as opposed to documents pertaining to his time in office, which could be subject to executive privilege claims. \"The fact that they seek personal documents doesn't mean that they're not targeting the president,\" Strawbridge responded, adding that the oversight and intelligence committees have specified that they're investigating Trump in his role as president. He added that the Supreme Court previously ruled in Clinton v. Jones, when it rejected a broader immunity argument, that there's \"still a need to ensure the president is not going to face undue harassment or distraction and there's a necessity to accommodate him.\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor throws a wrench into Trump's claim that subpoenas for his finances impede him from carrying out his duties Wikimedia Commons Justice Sotomayor noted that Congress has a long history of subpoenaing documents from the executive branch and obtaining them. \"In some of those cases, we have said ... that a congressional subpoena is valid so long as there is a conceivable legislative purpose, and the records are relevant to that purpose,\" she said.  \"I see a tremendous separation of powers problem when you're talking about placing a heightened standard or clear statement ... on an investigation that a committee is embarking upon.\" Sotomayor pointed specifically to the House Intelligence Committee's stated purpose in seeking Trump's financial records: investigating efforts by foreign entities to influence the US political process. She asked Trump's lawyer, Patrick Strawbridge to elaborate on why Trump's team argued the subpoenas for his records were \"irrelevant to that purpose\" and that the investigation itself is illegitimate. Sotomayor also noted that none of the subpoenas for Trump's financial records have asked him, personally, to turn them over. Instead, the subpoenas are to the president's banks and accounting firm, which raises questions about Strawbridge's argument that the investigations impede Trump from carrying out his duties.  Trump's lawyer says House subpoenas are a 'harassment and infringement' on Trump's ability to govern Getty Images / Paul Morigi Justice Stephen Breyer asked Trump's defense lawyer, Patrick Strawbridge, about the Watergate scandal, in which the court turned over Oval Office tapes to the special prosecutor. \"Why isn't whatever standard applies to personal papers a weaker one, not a stronger one?\" Breyer asked. Strawbridge responded that subpoenaing \"decades worth of papers\" related to Trump and his family \"poses an obvious problem with respect to harassment and infringement upon the ability of the executive to discharge his duties 24 hours a day.\" \"Unlike Congress, the president is never in recess, and these types of subpoenas are going to be particularly troublesome,\" Strawbridge said. Breyer cut him off, asking, \"Whatever it is, why wouldn't whatever standard applies to personal papers before the presidency be equal to or weaker than the standard for materials that is the working of the administration at the time?\" Strawbridge said that the Supreme Court has previously ruled that Congress does not have the power to inquire about the private affairs of any individual. \"That's distinct from whatever interest they may have informing themselves about the workings of government,\" he said, adding, \"Now, that informing power does not extend to the president, it generally applies to lower executive branch officials and agencies.\" Trump's lawyer appears to contradict the White House's position on impeachment Associated Press Justice Clarence Thomas asked Trump's defense lawyer, Patrick Strawbridge, to distinguish between congressional subpoenas related to impeachment and legislative subpoenas. Strawbridge responded that the court previously ruled that these are \"two very different powers\" and that when impeachment is \"properly pending before any body of the House, the ability to subpoena pursuant to impeachment is co-extensive with that of the court.\" During Trump's impeachment, however, the White House refused to cooperate with any congressional subpoenas, arguing that they were invalid. It also instructed all executive branch employees not to comply with the House's requests for documents and testimony. On Tuesday, Strawbridge said the committees who subpoenaed Trump's financial records have \"waived any reliance on impeachment,\" and that they \"don't even have jurisdiction over impeachment.\" He was likely referring to the fact that the House Judiciary Committee oversees impeachment hearings, not the oversight, intelligence, and financial services committees — who subpoenaed Trump's bank and accounting firm for his records. Justice Clarence Thomas asks Trump's lawyers whether Congress has any power to request or subpoena private documents REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst Justice Clarence Thomas asked Trump's personal defense lawyer, Patrick Strawbridge, whether the House has the power to request or subpoena any private documents. Strawbridge responded that it may have \"limited powers in some cases,\" and Thomas asked him to elaborate on what those circumstances may be. Strawbridge stressed that Congress has \"some implied power,\" but that it must be related to a legislative purpose and not an oversight role. \"Most often, that's going to take the view of forward-looking information, perhaps aggregated information, and not an attempt to reassemble a precise factual history,\" he added. Trump team notes that the subpoenas are unprecedented, but Justice Ginsburg points out the House has subpoenaed several previous presidents during investigations like Watergate and Whitewater Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images Patrick Strawbridge, one of Trump's personal defense lawyers arguing the case, said the House subpoenas for the president's financial records are unprecedented. But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted that the House has subpoenaed previous presidents, citing the Watergate scandal and in the 1990s during the Whitewater investigation during Bill Clinton's administration. Strawbridge responded by saying that almost all the cases Ginsburg cited involved \"cooperative efforts\" and that none involved a challenge to the scope of the legislative committee to request documents. What you need to know about the cases Reuters Last year, the president sued the Manhattan district attorney's office in New York to stop investigators from obtaining his tax returns as part of an investigation into his business activities. In arguing the case, Trump's attorneys claimed he has \"absolute immunity\" not just from criminal prosecution but from any investigation while in office. The House oversight, financial services, and intelligence committees also subpoenaed Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, and two of his banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, as part of an investigation into the president's potential conflicts of interest and foreign business ties. Trump then sued the oversight committee in federal court in Washington, DC, to block the Mazars subpoena, and he sued the financial services and intelligence committees in New York to block the subpoenas to Deutsche and Capital One. In these congressional cases, Trump's lawyers argued that Congress does not have a legitimate legislative purpose in examining his records and is going on a \"sweeping\" and \"extraordinary\" fishing expedition. In one instance last year, Trump's legal team made headlines when it argued that even if Trump were to \"shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue\" — as he claimed during the 2016 campaign — he could not be prosecuted or investigated for the crime while in office. In all three cases, lower courts rejected Trump's arguments and said the president has to turn over his records to congressional and New York state investigators. Now, the Supreme Court is Trump's last hope to stop the public from gaining access to his closely held financial records. Read the original article on Business Insider",
    "[] The White House on Tuesday denied President Donald Trump was trying to distract from the novel coronavirus pandemic by making the extraordinary accusation over the weekend that his predecessor, Barack Obama, had committed unspecified crimes. Days after the Justice Department asked a judge to drop the criminal case against Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, Trump asserted on Sunday, without providing evidence, that Obama had some sort of illegal role in the FBI's initial investigation of Trump's first, incoming national security adviser, Michael Flynn. \"The biggest political crime in American history, by far!\" Trump tweeted, as he shared another tweet from a conservative talk radio host who said \"the outgoing president used his last weeks in office to target incoming officials and sabotage the new administration.\" He did not provide details in the tweet, which was among 126 he wrote or shared from others on Sunday -- Mother's Day -- including many from conservative commentators -- his third-highest number of tweets and retweets in one day, according to the data analytics company Factba.se. Early Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted that \"OBAMAGATE makes Watergate look small time!\" MORE: Any Obama officials involved in Flynn 'unmasking' declassified: Source In an interview Tuesday morning on ABC's “Good Morning America,” presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden said \"this is all about diverting attention.\" “Can you imagine any other president of the United States focusing on this at the moment when a country is just absolutely concerned about their health, the health of their children, the health of their families?” Biden told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos. “We have an economic crisis, we have a health crisis,\" Biden said. \"This is all about diverting attention. Focus on what's in front of us. Get us out of this, Mr President.\" MORE: Biden pushes back on Trump's testing claims, labels coronavirus response 'incompetent' White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in response that the way the FBI treated Flynn as it questioned him “should trouble each and every American.” \"It is not a distraction to bring this up,” McEnany said during an interview Tuesday morning with Fox News. “'Obamagate,'” Trump said at a news conference Monday. \"It's been going on for a long time. It's been going on from before I even got elected. And it's a disgrace that it happened.\" Asked by a reporter exactly what crime he was accusing Obama of committing, Trump would not say. \"You know what the crime is,\" Trump told the reporter from The Washington Post. \"The crime is very obvious to everybody. All you have to do is read the newspapers, except yours.\" Obama on Friday during a private conversation with former members of his administration said that he had concerns with how the Justice Department had moved to drop its case against Flynn, according to an audio recording obtained by Yahoo News. \"Our basic understanding of rule of law is at risk,\" Obama said, according to the recording. \"And when you start moving in those directions, it can accelerate pretty quickly as we’ve seen in other places.” White House denies Trump accusing Obama of unspecified crimes to distract from coronavirus originally appeared on abcnews.go.com",
    "[] With reopening well underway in some states — and reopening plans now taking shape in states that remain locked down — America’s harried, anxious parents are suddenly being asked to consider whether they feel comfortable sending their children back to school. Late last month, President Trump told governors to “seriously consider” and “maybe get going on” school openings “because a lot of people are wanting to have [them]” and “young children have done very well in this disaster that we’ve all gone through.” Then on Wednesday, Trump reiterated his belief that schools should reopen after Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, cautioned the Senate about the unknown effects the coronavirus has on juveniles in light of recent reports about a multisystem, COVID-triggered inflammatory disease that has killed three children. “They should open the schools, absolutely,” Trump told reporters. “I was surprised by his answer. To me it’s not an acceptable answer, especially when it comes to schools.” “Now where you have an incident, one out of a million, one out of 500,000, will something happen? Perhaps,” the president continued, referring to the rare yet tragic complication. “But, you know, you can be driving to school and some bad things can happen too. We’re going to open our country. We want it open.” Trump is probably right that cases of the Kawasaki-like disease are too few and far between — for now — to change most policymakers’ minds about the safety of returning to school. He is also right that children have “done” better than adults overall: Confirmed COVID-19 cases among minors are uncommon (2 percent of the U.S. total) and significantly less likely to be severe. As of May 6, there were 10 deaths in children 14 and younger and 48 deaths in those between the ages of 15 and 24 — though some early research suggests that asymptomatic coronavirus infections might be more prevalent among children than the confirmed case count would indicate. Either way, reopening schools would not only help kids start learning — and, in many poor districts, eating — again. It would also help parents get back to work. Other countries and regions, including Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, Germany, Denmark, France and Belgium, are already doing it. As a result, administrators nationwide have been contacting families and asking for feedback. “We are exploring opening our doors to a reduced number of students on July 1st, with new protocols in place to minimize health risks,” one California preschool emailed earlier this month. “We’d like to gauge from the community who among you would be interested in returning on July 1st ...  PLEASE EMAIL ASAP to let us know.” The immediate, instinctive answer — as any preschool parent will attest — is a resounding yes. Working from home while caring for young, cooped-up children is somewhere between challenging and maddening. But the real risk of sending kids back to school isn’t to the kids themselves. It’s to everybody else. What parents are actually being asked to assess when administrators request “feedback” on reopening is whether that risk — the risk that children will wind up spreading the coronavirus to teachers, parents, grandparents and beyond — is one they’re willing to take. In other words: What role do children play in the pandemic? Do they pass the pathogen to adults and continue the chain of transmission? The trouble for parents is that even the experts don’t seem to know the answer to that question. Consider two headlines from the last week or so. “New Studies Add to Evidence that Children May Transmit the Coronavirus: Experts said the new data suggest that cases could soar in many U.S. communities if schools reopen soon” — New York Times, May 5 “Coronavirus: Reopening of schools ‘unlikely to cause huge problems,’ disease expert says” — Yahoo News U.K., May 13 It’s almost impossible to reconcile those claims. Both cite experts. Both are current. One says “cases could soar” if schools reopen. The other says they won’t. So what does the actual data say? Like so much else with COVID-19, it’s complicated. The Yahoo News U.K. report leads with remarks by Matt Keeling, a professor of populations and disease at the University of Warwick, who told the outlet that because “children are not suffering substantially from this pandemic,” any “phased opening of school is unlikely to cause huge problems.” Keeling’s remarks were a response to a brand-new summary of the international evidence on immunity and the spread of the coronavirus by children published Wednesday by the U.K.’s Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), which claims that “children are not, to date, substantially contributing to the household transmission of SARS-CoV-2.” And the HIQA summary is based, in turn, on seven international studies: “five that investigated intra-familial and close contact transmission, one that examined transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools and one that was a mathematical modelling study estimating age-specific transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2.” None of these studies found substantial household or school transmission. A case series of 10 young patients admitted to children’s hospitals in China found one 3-month-old infant who may have infected both parents. A similar study of 74 children with COVID-19 admitted to two hospitals in China reported no evidence that the virus was transmitted from these 74 children to others. A Chinese analysis of public health data on roughly 1,000 patients reported no cases of infection by an “index patient” 15 or younger and only three cases of infection by someone under 18. An investigation of a cluster of cases in the French Alps followed one infected child who visited three schools and attended one ski class while symptomatic; ultimately, researchers tested 73 of the child’s 173 identified contacts and found one additional case of COVID-19. An Australian report released on April 26 examined the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from 18 confirmed cases (nine students and nine staff) to 863 close contacts (735 students and 128 staff) in 15 schools. It found one child who was likely infected by a peer and another who was likely infected by a teacher. Finally, a Chinese modeling study estimating age-specific transmissibility concluded that SARS-CoV-2 has “high transmissibility among adults aged 25 years or older, but low transmissibility among children … younger than 14 years.” So far, so good. The problem, however, is that the HIQA summary also characterized five of these studies as “low to moderate quality”; the other two, it noted, had not been peer-reviewed. What’s more, HIQA didn’t include all the relevant research in its report. Some of that work supports the U.K. agency’s takeaway that children are not “substantially contributing” to transmission; researchers in Norway and Iceland, for instance, were able to find only “five documented cases of likely spread of disease from children.” But other research lends support to the New York Times’ far less sanguine conclusion. The first study cited by the Times (and not by HIQA) was published April 29 in the journal Science. In it, an international team analyzed data from two cities in China — Wuhan, where the virus first emerged, and Shanghai — and found that children were about a third as susceptible to coronavirus infection as adults were. But they also found that when schools were open, children had “about three times as many contacts as adults, and three times as many opportunities to become infected, essentially evening out their risk.” Based on their data, the researchers estimated that closing schools is not enough to halt an outbreak, but it can “reduce the surge by about 40 to 60 percent and slow the epidemic’s course.” “My simulation shows that yes, if you reopen the schools, you’ll see a big increase in the reproduction number, which is exactly what you don’t want,” the team’s mathematical epidemiologist told the Times. The second study cited by the Times was published earlier this month by Germany’s best-known virologist and coronavirus expert, Christian Drosten. His team tested 47 infected children between the ages of 1 and 11 — 15 had an underlying condition or were hospitalized; the rest were mostly free of symptoms — and found that the asymptomatic children harbored just as much virus as their symptomatic peers, or adults. In fact, sometimes their viral loads were higher. “In this cloud of children, there are these few children that have a virus concentration that is sky-high,” Drosten concluded, noting that there is a significant body of work suggesting that a person’s viral load tracks closely with their infectiousness. “So I’m a bit reluctant to happily recommend to politicians that we can now reopen day cares and schools.” And so for American parents — and policymakers — the right response is probably to wait and see. All of the existing (and conflicting) studies on kids and transmissibility are small-scale and preliminary. With testing still anything but universal here — and with children usually showing mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all — determining which kids are infected is hard enough; determining which kids may be spreading the virus would be even harder. In Germany, students are already self-administering tests in schoolyards. The U.S. is a long way from being able to do that. It may be that asymptomatic kids pass the pathogen to teachers and relatives without anyone ever knowing; the Robert Koch Institute of public health, Germany’s equivalent of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recently found that children get infected in roughly equal proportions to adults, even if they don’t show signs of sickness. Hopefully, a new study by the National Institutes of Health will help answer some of these questions. The project, called HEROS, has already started to enroll participants; ultimately, it will follow 6,000 people from 2,000 families and collect information on which children get infected with the virus and whether they pass it on to other family members. Until those results are released, Americans would do well to remember the remarks Fauci delivered Tuesday before the Senate — the same remarks Trump later objected to. “We really better be very careful, particularly when it comes to children,” Fauci said in response to Sen. Rand Paul, who called keeping schools closed “a huge mistake.” “You’re right in the numbers that children in general do much, much better,” Fauci added. “But I am very careful and hopefully humble in knowing that I don’t know everything about this disease. And that’s why I’m very reserved in making broad predictions.” _____ Click here for the latest coronavirus news and updates.

    "[] How the coronavirus sparked a tsunami of misinformation. Here's everything you need to know: What's being said?\nSocial media has been awash in lies, rumors, and distortions about the coronavirus, its origins, and potential cures almost since the pandemic's start. NewsGuard, a private company that rates websites' reliability, has identified 203 websites throughout the world promoting COVID-19 misinformation. Among the most popular COVID-19 myths were \"Garlic can cure COVID-19,\" \"A group funded by Bill Gates patented the coronavirus,\" and \"The COVID-19 virus is a man-made bioweapon.\" The World Health Organization is calling the deluge of misinformation \"an infodemic,\" while Google, Facebook, and Twitter are instituting policies to help slow the spread of lies. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook fact-checkers have \"taken down hundreds of thousands of pieces of misinformation,\" and slapped warnings on 40 million posts during March alone, the company says. Last week, YouTube removed a video titled \"Plandemic\" that had been viewed millions of times, featuring discredited microbiologist and anti-vaxxer Judy Mikovits. In the video and a book that reached No. 1 on Amazon, Mikovits contends the coronavirus was created and spread by a conspiracy of wealthy people and scientists such as Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, to bolster vaccine rates and make money. Mikovits has been claiming her career was destroyed by Fauci and other scientists since she falsely reported in a 2009 study, later retracted by the journal that published it, that a retrovirus caused chronic fatigue syndrome. What's the motive?\nFor some, profit; for others, attention. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his InfoWars website have warned their audience that the coronavirus is a man-made tool to winnow the world's population. InfoWars was ordered by the FDA and FTC last month to stop peddling products such as \"SuperSilver Whitening Toothpaste,\" and \"Superblue Silver Immune Gargle\" that Jones portrayed as coronavirus cures and prophylactics. He and many other websites popular on Facebook are hawking colloidal silver as a cure for coronavirus; taken in large doses, it turns your skin blue. The idea that there is a magical treatment has been promoted by President Trump, who suggested that UV light and disinfectant could be used to kill the virus inside the lungs \"almost like a cleaning.\" He also spent weeks promoting an anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, as \"one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.\" That led to a huge spike in sales of the drug, and to state governments stockpiling 30 million doses of it. Several studies have subsequently found that hydroxychloroquine has no benefit for COVID-19 patients and can cause life-threatening heart arrhythmias. Why so much disinformation?\nStanford University Professor Robert N. Proctor says humanity has always been susceptible to misinformation during \"a time of great fear ... from the burning of witches on up to hydroxychloroquine.\" Conspiracy theories, he says, make powerless people feel they have some inside knowledge and thus some control over frightening events. Misinformation also spread easily during prior health scares, including the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918, the AIDS epidemic, and SARS in 2003. The fact that so little is known about the coronavirus also fuels the lies and rumors. \"It's frustrating when responsible media say, 'Look, we don't know the answers yet,'\" said Carl T. Bergstrom, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Washington who studies misinformation. What are state actors doing?\nThe State Department has warned that Iran, China, and Russia are using coronavirus propaganda to damage the U.S. and distract their own populations from their poor official response. A Russian state TV network, for example, falsely reported that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation created the coronavirus in conjunction with pharmaceutical companies to profit off therapies. Both Russian and Iranian state sources have claimed the virus is a U.S.-created bioweapon, and the state-run China Global Television Network says the pandemic was started by Americans who went to Wuhan, China, for a military athletic competition in October. What's the 5G theory?\nOne of the most popular conspiracy theories holds that the pandemic was actually caused by radio waves from that new mobile technology, noting that it was deployed in Wuhan shortly before the outbreak. In Britain, arsonists torched at least 20 cellphone towers and engineers have been harassed. In one clip, viewed more than 2 million times, a British woman asks telecom engineers why they are laying what she believes to be 5G cables, saying the cables are going to \"kill everyone.\" In her video, book, and tweets, Mikovits promotes even more bizarre ideas, including that sheltering in place, washing your hands, and wearing a mask can increase your likelihood of getting COVID-19. These protective measures, she says, are \"literally killing people.\" In the scientific community, Mikovits is known as a quack who was fired from a research institute and arrested for stealing equipment. But in the social media era, said Renée DiResta, who studies disinformation at the Stanford Internet Observatory, what millions of people believe \"is essentially determined by whoever runs the best marketing campaign.\" The myth of 'patient zero'\nMaatje Benassi has become a poster case for coronavirus conspiracy theories and the havoc that they can wreak. In October, the U.S. Army reservist and mother of two competed in the Military World Games, an Olympics-style event held in Wuhan, China. During the final lap of the cycling competition, Benassi fell and suffered a concussion, although she got up and finished the race. Over ensuing months, the Chinese government and Chinese social media promulgated the unfounded theory that Americans competing in the games had created the virus in a lab and smuggled it into the country through Benassi, calling her \"patient zero.\" Benassi says she's never had COVID-19. The narrative was co-opted by American conspiracy theorist George Webb, who spread it across YouTube. Benassi has since been flooded with death threats and seen her home address published online. \"It's like waking up from a bad dream going into a nightmare day after day,\" she said. \"Every time you're going to Google my name, it will pop up as patient zero.\" This article was first published in the latest issue of The Week magazine.

    "[] WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are open to making changes to close what some see as a loophole in a new rule aimed at curbing global chip sales to blacklisted Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies Ltd, two U.S. officials said on Wednesday. The new rule, unveiled by the Commerce Department on Friday, expands U.S. authority to require licenses for sales to Huawei of semiconductors made abroad with U.S. technology, amplifying the department's reach to halt exports to the world's No. 2 smartphone maker. But the rule only includes chips designed by Huawei and does not cover shipments if they are sent directly to Huawei's customers. Some industry lawyers see this as a significant loophole. Asked on Wednesday about the potential for adjusting the rule to close that gap, State Department official Christopher Ashley Ford said the rule itself would provide regulators with the insight to determine if it should be altered. The rule will \"give us a great deal more information upon which to base export control decisions as we move forward and try to find the right answer to these challenges including by adapting, if we need to, if Huawei tries to work around our rules in some way,\" Ford said. He added that regulators would watch and \"certainly make any changes that we think are necessary.\" Huawei declined to comment. The company was added to Commerce's \"entity list\" last year due to national security concerns, amid accusations it violated U.S. sanctions on Iran, stole intellectual policy and could spy on customers, allegations Huawei has denied. Frustration among China hawks in the administration that the entity listing was not doing enough to cut off Huawei's access to supplies prompted a crackdown effort, first reported by Reuters in November, that culminated in Friday's rule. An industry lawyer who declined to be named said one way to change the rule would be to tweak the language to capture chips sold \"to the benefit of\" Huawei, but noted such a change would pose its own challenges. Speaking as part of the same briefing with Ford, Cordell Hull, a Commerce Department official, said the agency's enforcement arm \"will be looking at efforts to circumvent the rules.

    "[] A lively debate is occurring about which pandemic-related emergency measures should be made permanent once things return to normal. Work from home? Online college classes? Tele-visits with the family doctor? Zoom cocktail parties? My candidate: live-streaming of oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court, which occurred for the first time this month when the justices were hearing cases over the telephone. Apparently a lot of people agree. Fix the Court, which campaigns for more transparency from the justices, is citing a PSB poll showing that 70% of respondents support continuing live online access to oral arguments, while 30% support a return to the court’s pre-pandemic practice of posting audio on its website on Fridays. (The arguments take place on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, meaning that by Friday an argument is old news.) As Fix the Court notes, there have been mixed reviews for another aspect of the court’s pandemic proceedings: an innovation in which Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. called on the justices to ask questions in order of seniority. The usual format is more of a free-for-all, though this term the court adopted a rule saying that lawyers could speak for two minutes before being interrupted. Lyle Denniston, the longtime Supreme Court correspondent for the Baltimore Sun, complained on Twitter that the format “harms equal status of each Justice, gives the [chief justice] arbitrary power, diminishes cross-bench exchanges, promotes wool-gathering by lawyers, prizes order over depth, lets technology triumph, looks amateurish.” Then there is the question of whether Roberts treated his colleagues fairly in managing the questioning, particularly whether he was evenhanded in cutting off questions by one justice and moving to another. Leah Litman, a law professor at the University of Michigan, conducted a granular analysis of the arguments from the teleconferenced arguments. Although she concluded that Roberts “appears to have done a somewhat evenhanded job of moderating the questions, at least ideologically,” she also noted that “the three shortest questioning periods the chief [justice] allowed were for his female colleagues.” I have to admit that I didn’t notice the gender disparities Litman cited when I listened to the arguments. And, to be fair, Litman acknowledges, even as she faults Roberts’ performance, that “this was the court’s first attempt at this new format, and a limited sample of only 10 arguments. And it is possible that if the format continues, the court will get better at it.” Roberts, who is acutely conscious of the way the court is perceived, should take Litman’s comments to heart and aim to do better if the court decides to continue its pandemic questioning protocols once it returns to in-person arguments. And it should do so. The take-your-turn format is preferable to the free-for-all that led to irksome interruptions, and apparently Justice Clarence Thomas agrees. Thomas long has been criticized for not asking questions at oral arguments, but he was an active and sometimes incisive questioner in the pandemic version. (\"Thomas Speaks\" seemed to garner the same attention as \"Garbo Talks.\" But Thomas' participation in oral arguments isn't just a novelty. It's useful for both the public and for advocates in a case to know what's on his mind.) Whatever the court does about protocol for questioning, the other innovation it adopted because of the pandemic — livestreaming of arguments — must be made permanent. For citizens eager to follow the court’s public proceedings in real time, justices delayed is justice denied. For the record:\n12:51 PM, May. 22, 2020: This has been corrected to note that the firm that conducted the poll was PSB.",
    "[] As Donald Trump’s electoral prospects diminish amid a pandemic-induced recession, his blame-deflecting attacks have become ever more desperate. The most immediate and obvious damage from a presidential performance characterized by desperation and demagoguery is to be measured in terms of public health and the toll of the coronavirus. At last count, the United States, with 4.2 percent of the world’s population, had 31 percent of the coronavirus infections and 29 percent of the deaths. This type of damage is likely to get even worse as Trump rolls the dice on an economic recovery between now and November 3 that he hopes will overshadow the resurgence of disease and death that epidemiologists say will result from premature relaxation of pandemic-required restrictions. The ruthless partisanship and attack tactics of Trump and his followers also have other ill consequences, however, that will persist long after the pandemic has eased and any thoughts of drinking disinfectant or popping hydroxychloroquine pills have faded. Moreover, many of the ill effects will persist well after Trump’s presidency, despite efforts of his successors to repair the damage. In international relations and foreign policy, relations with China are perhaps the prime example, with a plunge into a new Cold War being partly a byproduct of the attempt by Trump (and those executing his tactics, especially Secretary of State Mike Pompeo) to use China as a foil to divert blame from Trump’s own mishandling of the pandemic. Some of the most fundamental damage is to institutions and procedures that involve law and national security that are supposed to be beyond partisan politics. The damage includes not only the immediate politicization of issues of the day but also a subversion of government bureaucracies that have important legal and national security responsibilities. It also includes damage to public trust in those institutions. Trust is essential for those institutions to perform their functions. Damage to that sort of trust takes a long time to repair. Multifaceted attacks on the rule of law have been in large part the work of Attorney General William Barr. In a rapid series of moves, Barr has turned the Department of Justice into a political weapon to protect Trump’s friends, punish his opponents or those who unearth embarrassing facts, and sustain partisan narratives about law enforcement, national security, and relations with foreign states. Most recently, the emphasis in the Trumpian tactics has been on a narrative about supposed malfeasance the previous administration committed while national security agencies performed their duty of investigating the many dimensions of Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. election. This narrative dates back to the beginning of Trump’s presidency, with the accusations of malfeasance intended to counteract the politically embarrassing fact that the Russian interference was one of the factors that may have helped Trump to win the presidency, and that rather than rebuffing such help and reporting it to the responsible authorities, Trump and his campaign welcomed it. (Or in the unexpurgated words of Donald Trump, Jr., “I love it.”) With the added desperation brought on by the pandemic and associated recession, Trump now is not even bothering to construct a semi-coherent script for the narrative, as demonstrated by a remarkable exchange with a Washington Post reporter at a recent press conference. When the reporter asked, “What crime exactly are you accusing President Obama of committing?” Trump responded, “Obamagate. It’s been going on for a long time. It’s been going on from before I even got elected. And it’s a disgrace that it happened.” After more of such a non-answer, the reporter posed the question again, to which Trump replied, “You know what the crime is. The crime is very obvious to everybody. All you have to do is read the newspapers, except yours.” Trump has thus brought partisan invective to its highest—or lowest—form ever: pure innuendo, uncluttered not only by any facts but even by any substantive assertions. Flynn as Partisan Prop Trump’s short-tenured first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has been at the center of this latest amended narrative. Barr shocked prosecutors when he ordered the dropping of charges on Flynn, in a contorted filing, for crimes to which Flynn had already pleaded guilty. Now, the Trump camp is trying to make something of the fact that Flynn’s identity had been “unmasked” by officials endeavoring to interpret intercepted communications involving, among other things, Flynn’s off-the-books dealings with the Russians. Richard Grenell, the partisan warrior whom Trump installed as acting director of national intelligence, made a public show of delivering to Barr’s department the identities of officials in the previous administration who had requested the unmasking, with Fox News evidently having been tipped off to be able to record the delivery. The whole show was obviously intended to suggest that those officials had done something nefarious. No evidence has surfaced that they did anything improper. Such unmasking, under strict controls as an exception to otherwise strict concealment of the identity of U.S. persons referenced in intercepted foreign communications, is a necessary and well-established procedure. Officials in the Trump administration have used the procedure substantially more often than their counterparts in the Obama administration ever did. That investigators scrutinized and questioned Flynn also was well-grounded and fully justified, not only in the context of what Russia was doing in trying to influence both the election and U.S. policy but also because of traditional counterintelligence concerns. As Mary McCord, former acting assistant attorney general for national security points out, the Russians knew, as the American public did not at the time, that Flynn was lying about doing business with the Russian ambassador. That made him a prime target for Russian blackmail. Seemingly forgotten in the attempt to make Flynn a prop in accusations of misconduct in the previous administration was how the early Trump White House—and specifically Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Counsel Donald McGahn—determined that Flynn’s repeated lying about his conversations with the Russian ambassador, both to the FBI and to Vice President Pence, meant he had to go. Also forgotten is not only that Flynn admitted in court that he was guilty of that lying but that his admission was part of a plea deal in a case in which he could have been hit with additional charges of concealing paid work he had done for the Turkish government. But those desperate to construct a partisan attack will take whatever prop they can get. A few seconds of reflection should be sufficient to realize how vacuous the charges are about officials wanting to “unmask Flynn.” By definition, the identity of a U.S. person mentioned in an intercept is unknown to those who might request an unmasking. The Dog That Didn’t Bark Before the Election An even bigger and more glaring fact of recent history concerns what did and did not become public knowledge before the 2016 election when revelations could have made a difference in the election result. That the Russian influence activity, and how it evidently was intended not only to discredit American democracy but also to tilt the contest against Hillary Clinton and in favor of Trump, was serious enough to have become an object of concern to U.S. security agencies was a bombshell story waiting to be leaked. If either the Obama administration or the supposed “deep state” had wanted to torpedo Trump’s candidacy, the story would have leaked back then. It didn’t. The only election-influencing revelation by the security agencies during the election campaign was James Comey’s announcement that the FBI was looking again at Hillary Clinton’s emails. Comey later stated there wasn’t anything material that came out of that investigation. In contrast, there was a great deal that came out of inquiries into the Russian influence campaign, as the world knows now from press reporting, public judgments from the intelligence community, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation and prosecutions (including the prosecution of Michael Flynn), and a separate inquiry of the Senate intelligence committee. In much of Trumpland, none of this will matter. Many of the faithful will hear cries of “Obamagate” and that will be enough for them to believe that something nefarious must have happened under that theme. State television—that is, Fox News—will ensure that even American coronavirus deaths moving into six figures will not detract attention from the theme. Long-Term Consequences All Americans—including partisans of every stripe and even strong supporters of Trump—ought to be concerned about the longer-term effects of the corruption and discrediting of the national security procedures and institutions involved. There will be more foreign attempts at undermining American democracy, and not just by Russia—although Russia itself already seems likely to do it again. There will be more counterintelligence cases that raise the danger of serious compromises to U.S. national security, and not just cases involving incoming national security advisers. To the extent that foreign machinations tilt in favor of one U.S. political party over another, it is unknown which party might be favored in any future foreign caper. Damage can take the form of officials self-deterring and not using the tools available to them to counter foreign covert action and intelligence collection. It can take the form of officials self-censoring and not sounding alarms about foreign influence attempts, for fear of being dragged into partisan battles. The attractiveness to people who work in such national security organizations will be further diminished, with the effectiveness of those organizations diminished as well. The damage may involve persistent bad habits among members of Congress in looking at such matters more in partisan terms than in national security terms. And it may involve public cynicism and distrust that leads to real threats being dismissed while ones manufactured for partisan reasons get attention instead.

    "[] Just when you thought it couldn’t get any weirder, President Trump posted Tuesday on Twitter that he had “done more for the black community than any president since Abraham Lincoln.” Of course, Trump says untrue things on Twitter on a regular basis. But this one, at this moment in time, seemed particularly egregious. Does Trump really believe he’s a better president for black Americans than Lyndon Johnson, who fought for and secured passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, two landmark pieces of legislation that helped bring the Jim Crow era to an end? Better than Jimmy Carter, who named more blacks, Latinos and women to the federal judiciary than all previous presidents combined? Better than Barack Obama, the nation’s first African American president? Or does he just think that if he says it feverishly enough, people will believe it? With Americans across the country taking to the streets to protest racial injustice, Trump doubled down. On Wednesday, he posted a new tweet saying that he’d done more for black Americans than any president not just since Lincoln, but “with the possible exception of” Lincoln. In other words, now he’s saying that maybe he’s done more than Lincoln too. Wow. Lincoln, you may remember from high school, fought a devastating four-year war that risked the very existence of the nation in order to end slavery in the United States. He signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, freeing 3.2 million slaves with a single pen stroke. He fought for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery throughout the country. For his troubles, he was assassinated. And what’s Trump done? Well, for one thing, on May 29, just as outrage was welling and protests were starting over the killing of George Floyd, he released a statement proclaiming June to be African American Music Appreciation Month. In the middle of a deadly pandemic, a worldwide economic crisis and escalating racial unrest, he offered thanks to Sam Cooke, Little Richard, Ray Charles and others for their “classic guitar riffs, memorable hymns and uplifting beats,” including at “major sporting events.” OK, score one for Trump. I'm pretty sure that the man Trump calls “the late, great Abraham Lincoln” never did anything for African American Music Appreciation Month. (Trump also, by the way, recently proclaimed May to be “Jewish American Heritage Month.” So there’s a case to be made that he’s done more than anyone for the Jews too, with the possible exception of Moses.) In his tweets, the president tried lamely to defend his “I’ve done more for black Americans” assertion by pointing to the opportunity zone tax break he signed into law (which the New York Times says was designed to help poor neighborhoods but has “fueled a wave of developments financed by and built for the wealthiest Americans”). Trump also said he has presided over the lowest black unemployment rate in history, although those numbers are hopelessly out of date. Today, thanks to the coronavirus shutdowns, fewer than half of black adults are now employed. Trump’s claim is particularly brazen given his history of racist dog whistles, his call for the death penalty for the unjustly convicted Central Park Five, the accusations of racial discrimination in his real estate dealings, his praise of marchers at the white nationalist demonstration in Charlottesville and his recent threats to call in the military to subdue the protests over George Floyd’s killing. Instead of speaking up in favor of racial justice during this week’s demonstrations, Trump has been railing at “killers, terrorists, arsonists, anarchists, thugs, hoodlums, looters, ANTIFA & others.” Just for a sanity check, I called Columbia University history professor Eric Foner, an expert on the Civil War. Foner finds it “ludicrous” for the president to compare himself to Lincoln. “Of all the ignorant things Trump has said over the years, this is possibly the most absurd,” he said. Foner added that Lincoln was “intellectually inquisitive, modest, didn’t mind criticism and was always rethinking his positions, which is what you want in a crisis.” Trump, by contrast, is “stubborn, blind to the flaws in his own ideas” and “incapable of seeing where he falls short.” Sean Wilentz, a professor of American history at Princeton, noted Trump’s “abiding, almost morbid obsession with Lincoln,” which he said “has nothing to do with American history, about which Trump knows exactly nothing.” But because Lincoln is widely considered the greatest of presidents, Wilentz said, Trump feels he has to be better. “It’s his deep psychic wound talking again.” Trump is simply not in the same league with “the late, great Abraham Lincoln,” or for that matter with Johnson, Carter or Obama. But stay tuned to his Twitter feed for more bloviating, ahistorical, self-aggrandizement. What’s next — that he’s done more for the citizens of Gotham City than anyone with the possible exception of Batman? @Nick_Goldberg",
    "[] WASHINGTON — The Senate landscape has improved so much for Democrats that top party operatives are calling and texting one another to say they wish the election were held today. Election Day is still five months away, but recent polls, fundraising deficits and other problems for Republican incumbents have diminished their prospects and opened up several possible avenues for Democrats to take control of the chamber. “I would rather be the Democrats than Republicans right now,” said Jessica Taylor, the Senate editor of the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan election forecaster. “Democrats have expanded the map and put Republicans on defense even in some very red states.” The stakes are enormous for the legislative agenda of the next president — a re-elected Donald Trump or apparent Democratic nominee Joe Biden, who leads in national polls and most swing states — as well as the future of the courts. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the leader of the liberal wing, turns 88 next year, and the next Senate might get to confirm her successor. Trump's struggles in historically Republican states, like Arizona and Georgia, are creating collateral damage for his party's Senate candidates. Public skepticism of Trump's handling of the pandemic, and a Biden's expanding lead since the nationwide backlash to George Floyd's death, has put many GOP Senate candidates in a difficult position. They're forced to navigate a polarizing president whose ardent supporters they cannot afford to alienate and whose skeptics they'll likely need to attract to win. Democrats currently have 47 seats — four short of an outright majority and three shy of a controlling number should Biden win as his vice president could cast any tie-breaking votes. They’re more likely than not to lose one seat in Alabama, held by Sen. Doug Jones, but have lots of pickup opportunities. GOP-held seats in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and North Carolina are rated “toss up” by the Cook Political Report. Republicans are defending another five seats — in Iowa, Kansas, Montana and two in Georgia — that are in play but lean GOP, while Democrats are defending a seat in Michigan, where they’re favored. Of the 11 most competitive seats, Republicans are defending nine and Democrats two. A few months ago, Democrats felt uncertain about winning the majority as Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine are the only Republican targets in states Trump lost in 2016. Lately they’re feeling so good that Biden said at a fundraiser last week that he believes Democrats will pick up six Senate seats, without elaborating, according to a pool report. “For the moment, all of the things that need to happen for Democrats to take control of the Senate are happening,” said Guy Cecil, chairman of the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, which plans to spend more than $200 million to win the White House and Senate. “I’m optimistic that we can win back the Senate.” Some GOP operatives fear that races like Colorado and Arizona — once thought to be close — are slipping away while Maine and North Carolina are becoming too close for comfort. The nonpartisan newsletter Inside Elections rates Gardner's seat as \"tilt Democratic.\" Collins, meanwhile, did not join Trump during his visit to Maine on Friday, although she denied that the president was hurting her chances of re-election. But she said Democrats' attacks on her have had an impact as she has been out-raised and out-spent: \"It’s the barrage of unfounded falsehoods that have taken a toll,\" she said. Arizona's Republican Sen. Martha McSally has consistently trailed former astronaut Mark Kelly, husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, since last August, including by 13 points in a new Fox News survey. And in North Carolina, Thom Tillis, the GOP incumbent, and his Democratic opponent, former state Sen. Cal Cunningham, were statistically tied in two recent polls. A Montana State University poll in April found that state's Democratic governor, Steve Bullock, leading Republican Sen. Steve Daines by 7 points after Bullock's late entry breathed life into a red-state race that Democrats had all but written off. And in Georgia, appointed Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, sworn in this year, drew criticism for stock trades made on her behalf after early coronavirus briefings, for which she’s been cleared by the Justice Department. Loeffler, who said she was unaware of the transactions at the time, faces a contentious \"jungle primary\" that includes Republican Rep. Doug Collins. Republicans say the political environment will change as coronavirus lockdowns continue to ease after claiming more than 100,000 lives and Americans start to return to work. “Where we stand today is not an accurate picture of where we will be,” said GOP consultant Brad Todd, who counts Tillis and Gardner as clients. “We've been in such an abnormal position for the past 60 days that projecting it forward is careless, if not hubris.” Todd said Republicans will be helped by elevating the question of which party voters trust to rebuild the economy. \"I don't see anybody thinking that by October the economy has bounced back completely,” he said. National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman Jesse Hunt said most Democratic candidates have not yet faced the scrutiny that GOP incumbents have. “Democratic challengers have lived a charmed life up to this point,” Hunt said. “As the ad wars begin to heat up and the press begins to scrutinize these Democrats, their records and scandals will be laid bare for voters to see and evaluate whether or not they are capable of handling the immense challenges facing the Senate.” But Lauren Passalacqua, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Republicans will pay a price for their efforts to repeal or overturn Affordable Care Act protections, as health care remains a top issue for voters. \"Democrats are focused on the issues that matter to voters, including affordable health care coverage, and are reporting record-breaking grassroots support, which is how we’ve expanded the map and continue to move these races in our direction,\" she said. Republicans, meanwhile, are hyping the Michigan race after GOP businessman and Iraq war veteran John James out-raised Democratic Sen. Gary Peters. Polls roundly show Peters leading. Overall, the Cook Political Report's Taylor said, “Democratic challengers are by far out-raising the Republicans early on.”",
    "[] The University of California has cleared Regent George Kieffer of allegations of sexual misconduct, finding insufficient evidence to support a graduate student's claim that he repeatedly squeezed her thigh at a 2014 dinner meeting. Rebecca Ora, a UC Santa Cruz doctoral student in film and digital media, made her allegation during public comments at a UC regents meeting last November. She told board members that Kieffer had touched her thigh under the table while she and other students were discussing tuition with him and complained that UC officials had done “nothing” about her complaint, which she filed more than a year ago. Kieffer, a Los Angeles attorney and prominent civic leader, called the allegation at the time “absolutely false.” On Monday, he said he was \"certainly relieved that it's over.\" Ora could not be reached for comment. Ora initially opted to handle her complaint through the UC informal resolution process, but the two sides failed to come to an agreement. She then requested that UC conduct a formal investigation, which was handled by an independent outside investigator and completed several weeks ago. \"Based on the evidence gathered through the third-party investigation, the investigator did not find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the reported conduct occurred,\" the university said in a statement Monday. \"The University of California takes all allegations of misconduct, particularly those directed against a Regent, seriously and is committed to maintaining an environment in which all students, faculty and staff are free from harassment and discrimination.\" The university declined to provide further details, citing privacy laws.",

    "[] By Luc Cohen and Marianna Parraga CARACAS/MEXICO CITY(Reuters) - Last year, China replaced the United States as the No. 1 importer of oil from Venezuela, yet another front in the heated rivalry between Washington and Beijing. The United States had imposed sanctions on Venezuela's state-owned oil company as part of a bid to topple that country's socialist president, Nicolas Maduro. U.S. refineries stopped buying Venezuelan crude. Caracas' ally China, long a major customer, suddenly found itself the top purchaser. Through the first six months of 2019, it imported an average of 350,000 barrels per day of crude from Venezuela. But in August, Washington tightened its sanctions on Venezuela, warning that any foreign entity that continued to do business with the South American country's government could find itself subject to sanctions. State-owned China National Petroleum Corp, known as CNPC, stopped loading oil at Venezuelan ports that month. China's import data showed purchases started to slow, and by late 2019, abruptly stopped. China's largest oil company, like customers in some other countries, seemed to be knuckling under to U.S. President Donald Trump's threats, despite Chinese President Xi Jinping's professed support for Maduro. But China never stopped buying. Crude from Petroleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA, kept arriving at Chinese ports with the help of a Switzerland-based unit of Rosneft, Russia's state-owned oil company, and a roundabout delivery method that made it appear as if the oil's origin was Malaysia, Reuters has found. Between July 1 and Dec. 31, tanker ships delivered at least 18 shipments totaling 19.7 million barrels of rebranded Venezuelan crude to Chinese ports, Reuters determined. That finding is based on a review of ship-tracking data, internal PDVSA documents and interviews with four petroleum analysts who have tracked flows of Venezuelan oil around the globe. A unit of CNPC chartered at least one of those tankers, meaning it was responsible for the oil aboard, the ship-tracking data show. That vessel, called the Adventure, took on Venezuelan crude on July 18 and discharged it in China on Sept. 4, the data show. No charter information was available for the other ships that offloaded crude in China. CNPC did not respond to requests for comment. Those 18 shipments represented more than 5% of Venezuela's total exports in 2019, worth around $1 billion at market prices for the country's flagship crude grade, known as Merey, based on OPEC figures. The sales provided much-needed support to Maduro's government, though Reuters could not determine how much was added to state coffers; PDVSA often sells its crude at steep discounts, and some of its sales go to pay down debt rather than generate cash. The mislabeled shipments have continued into this year, Reuters found. The review used data available on financial information provider Refinitiv Eikon, photos culled from satellite imagery and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data transmitted by oil tankers. New York-based Refinitiv is part-owned by Reuters' parent company, Thomson Reuters. The shipping method - involving the transfer of oil between tanker ships at sea – has for months been under scrutiny by the Trump administration. Washington in February slapped sanctions on Rosneft Trading SA, the Geneva-based subsidiary of Rosneft <ROSN.MM>, which it alleges was helping Venezuela to export its oil using so-called ship-to-ship (STS) transfers to mask the true origin of the crude. Rosneft denied wrongdoing. \"The Company has always been conducting and is conducting its business in full compliance with applicable international legislation,\" Rosneft said in a June 5 statement in response to questions for this article. Russia's energy ministry did not reply to a request for comment. China's indirect imports of Venezuelan crude fall into something of a gray zone, according to Peter Harrell, a sanctions expert at the Center for a New American Security think tank in Washington. Harrell believes U.S. sanctions give Washington authority to punish foreign companies that purchase PDVSA oil through a middleman - particularly if the company \"knows or should have known it was Venezuelan crude.\" But that does not obligate the U.S. government to act. \"At the end of the day, these sanctions are fundamentally policy calls,\" Harrell said. Reuters could not independently verify if China knew the oil that reached its shores via Rosneft Trading came from Venezuela. The U.S. Treasury Department, which enforces trade sanctions, declined to comment. Asked about the Reuters findings, Elliott Abrams, the U.S. State Department's special representative for Venezuela, said in an interview that potential U.S. sanctions against Chinese companies purchasing transshipped crude were \"on the table.\" \"We will be taking individual actions with respect to STS transfers,\" Abrams said. China's General Administration of Customs did not respond to requests for comment. The Foreign Ministry told Reuters there was nothing improper about China's dealings with Venezuela. The ministry said U.S. sanctions had \"severely affected\" relations between Venezuela and the rest of the world, but said Beijing intends to continue trading with the country. Neither PDVSA, Venezuela's Oil Ministry, nor the Information Ministry - which responds to media inquiries on the government's behalf - responded to requests for comment. Venezuelan officials have repeatedly described U.S. sanctions on their country as illegal and unilateral. Oil analysts since last year have said Venezuelan oil was making its way to China by way of STS transfers. This account is the first to reveal the extent of those shipments and demonstrate how systematic the tactic has been. Reuters also reviewed internal PDVSA documents that showed the Rosneft unit was involved in moving the oil. So much PDVSA oil was shipped to China this way that the country's total 2019 imports of Venezuelan oil averaged 283,000 barrels a day. That's 24% higher than the 228,700 barrels a day reported by Chinese customs, according to Reuters calculations based on comparisons of the Refinitiv Eikon data to official Chinese customs data. That was not enough to offset entirely the impact that U.S. sanctions had on PDVSA; U.S. refiners were importing an average of 500,000 barrels per day when the sanctions were imposed in January 2019. But it helped Venezuela keep its oil industry alive at a time when the drop in demand from foreign buyers was creating a glut onshore, nearly forcing PDVSA to halt production in key oil fields. The STS maneuvers mirror tactics that Iran, whose oil industry is also under U.S. sanctions, has used to ship its oil to China for years. As Reuters documented in reports in 2019 and 2015, Iranian oil often is labeled as coming from neighboring Iraq.[https://reut.rs/2XIOeiE] A representative of the operator of a Chinese terminal where one such shipment unloaded in 2019 denied that the origin of the oil was Iranian. Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York, said in a statement \"how we sell or export our oil is no one's business.\" He said U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil exports are \"illegal.\" The Chinese shipments of Venezuelan crude were unusual for a variety of reasons, oil analysts said. STS transfers typically are used for legitimate purposes - such as offloading oil from deep-water drilling ships or pumping oil from large tankers onto smaller vessels that can navigate narrow or shallow waterways. The use of this technique to transport oil from Venezuela to China was not seen until the middle of last year, the oil analysts said. Tankers leaving Venezuela loaded with PDVSA crude did not travel straight to China as they had in the past. Instead, 15 tankers whose routes were reviewed by Reuters left Venezuela and first headed for the coast of Malaysia, tracking data show. A few miles offshore, in the Malacca Strait, each rendezvoused with a second, empty tanker that had pulled alongside. The full tanker then pumped its load into the waiting vessel, and in some cases into multiple smaller vessels. Eighteen of those receiving ships then headed to China, where the Venezuelan crude was offloaded and recorded as a product of Malaysia, Chinese customs records show. Reuters could not ascertain who changed the crude's labeled origin before it reached Chinese customs, nor whether doing so expressly violated any maritime laws or local laws in any applicable jurisdictions. Michelle Bockmann, markets editor and analyst at Lloyd's List, a shipping trade publication, said the relabeling was highly uncommon. With the exception of Iran, Bockmann said she could not recall any other instance of crude changing identities in this way. The imports were a break from China's past practice. China routinely has imported oil from countries such as Brazil and Russia using STS transfers. But Chinese customs accurately recorded the true countries of origin in those cases, according to Chinese customs data and Emma Li, a Singapore-based oil analyst with Refinitiv. In addition, Malaysia is a mid-sized oil producer that has not traditionally sold crude to China in the volumes recorded by Chinese customs last year, the records show. China's stated 2019 imports from Malaysia were 400% higher than levels recorded just three years earlier, and the highest ever recorded by Refinitiv Eikon, whose figures date to 2006. The Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation, the government agency largely in charge of foreign trade, did not respond to requests for comment, nor did Malaysia's state-owned oil company Petronas. This triangulated trade in Venezuelan oil is now in the crosshairs of the Trump administration. The company that lifted the oil from Venezuela for the China shipments identified by Reuters was Rosneft Trading, according to internal PDVSA documents reviewed by Reuters. Until late March, it was a major player in Venezuela's oil industry. The U.S. Treasury on Feb. 18 hit Rosneft Trading with sanctions for allegedly helping Venezuela sidestep the U.S. pressure campaign and sell its oil abroad. Among the tactics employed by Rosneft Trading were STS transfers, U.S. officials allege. By using one ship to haul crude out of Venezuela, then a second to deliver it to China, Rosneft Trading attempted to blur the chain of ownership and disguise the oil's provenance, Abrams, the State Department's special representative for Venezuela, told Reuters, without providing further proof of Rosneft's intentions. \"The whole purpose is to evade, the whole purpose is to mislead,\" Abrams said. On March 28, Rosneft announced it was ending its Venezuela operations and selling all its assets in the country to another, unnamed Russian state-owned firm. \"Rosneft has no ongoing business involvement, assets or operations in Venezuela; therefore, there is no subject for providing further comments,\" the company said in its June 5 statement to Reuters. The Trump administration, meanwhile, gave Rosneft Trading customers until May 20 to unwind their contracts with the company or face U.S. sanctions. Asked whether Chinese customers were involved in hiding the Venezuelan origin of the crude, Abrams said that Asian clients often did not care \"how it gets to them, what it's labeled, as long as they're getting what they bought.\" China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement it was not aware of the STS transfers in question. \"The cooperation between China and Venezuela will be carried out normally no matter how the situation changes,\" the statement read. \"It's legitimate and benefits the people of both countries and will not be affected by any unilateral sanction measures.\" Reuters could not ascertain the final customers for the PDVSA crude in China. But Venezuela's heavy Merey blend is a favored feedstock for refineries making asphalt in China, according to industry sources there. One of the earliest STS transfers involved the Adventure, a tanker chartered by a CNPC subsidiary. On July 18, it took on 1.9 million barrels of Venezuelan crude from another vessel in Malaysian waters, then headed for China, Refinitiv Eikon data show. The manager of the Adventure, Greece-based Eastern Mediterranean Maritime Ltd, said it had never entered into any agreement with PDVSA or any company sanctioned by the United States, and that it \"respects and complies in full\" with U.S. sanctions. The maritime company said the cargo's bill of lading and certificate of origin said the oil had come from Malaysia.  PIT STOP IN MALAYSIA Malaysia is a popular location for STS transfers of crude because of its proximity to Singapore, one of the world's largest oil trading and storage hubs. One of the STS transfers reviewed by Reuters occurred near Malaysia's port of Kuala Linggi; the rest took place outside the country's Tanjung Bruas port. To demonstrate how these STS transfers work, Reuters used records available on Refinitiv Eikon to reconstruct a shipment to China of 2 million barrels that left the Jose terminal in northeastern Venezuela on Aug. 5, 2019. The oil was carried aboard a Liberia-flagged vessel called the Delta Aigaion, according to Refinitiv Eikon data and an internal PDVSA document seen by Reuters. The crude was a heavy blend known as Merey 16, which is unique to Venezuela, and the customer was listed as Rosneft Trading, the PDVSA document shows. The Delta Aigaion sailed to waters off Malaysia near the port of Tanjung Bruas. There, the crew used a STS transfer to offload the Merey 16 to another tanker, the Malta-flagged Lipari, on Oct. 28, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The Lipari then headed for China, discharging its crude on Dec. 12 at the port of Zhanjiang, the data show. (For a graphic showing the path of the two ships, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2UpBlrH) Refinitiv Eikon ship-tracking data shows the location of ships and indicates how full they are. In this case, the data showed that the draft of each ship changed dramatically while the two were in the same location off Malaysia's coast at the same time. The draft is the vertical distance between the waterline and the bottom of a vessel's hull - a sign of how heavy a load it is carrying. The draft measurements showed that the Delta Aigaion arrived in Malaysia full and left empty, while the opposite was true for the Lipari - an indication that an oil transfer between the two took place. In a photo taken using a European Space Agency radar satellite and provided to Reuters by San Francisco-based earth imaging company Planet Labs, the Delta Aigaion and the Lipari can be seen approaching one another to start the oil transfer on Oct 28. The authenticity of that photo was verified by oil industry data provider TankerTrackers.com, which specializes in satellite image analysis for vessel tracking. Refinitiv Eikon retrieves location information from satellite images as well as from land-based sensors that collect data from ships' transponders. Ships are required by international maritime law to carry transponders to transmit information about their position, speed and destination. The U.S. government has accused tankers and shipping firms transporting oil from Venezuela and Iran of manipulating this data to evade authorities, either by flashing false destinations or simply turning off their transponders. The Delta Aigaion, while on its way to Venezuela in July after leaving its previous berthing in India, never indicated it was heading to the South American country, Refinitiv Eikon data show. The tanker listed its destination as \"For Orders,\" a message meaning it had not yet received instructions on where to go next. Delta Tankers Ltd and TMS Tankers Ltd, the shipping companies that manage the Delta Aigaion and Lipari, respectively, did not respond to requests for comment. MMC Corp Bhd and T.A.G. Marine Sdn Bhd, which operate the Tanjung Bruas and Kuala Linggi ports, respectively, did not respond to requests for comment. When the Lipari unloaded in the southwestern Chinese city of Zhanjiang, Chinese customs labeled the crude as \"Singma blend,\" a grade of crude that did not exist in the market before last year. Customs recorded the country of origin as Malaysia. Li, the Refinitiv analyst, said the labeling of the crude as a blend appears to be incorrect. If the crude were a blend of different grades - a practice common in the oil industry - the STS operation would have involved multiple vessels bringing crude from separate origins, Li said. Ship-tracking data show no indication that this occurred. \"It doesn't look like there's any blending,\" Li said. For 14 of the 18 tankers reviewed by Reuters, the grade of crude recorded by Chinese customs was Singma or Mal, another blend that did not exist before last year, data compiled by Li show. In other cases, the Venezuelan crude was given the names of more established Malaysian grades such as Miri or Kimanis, or was not specified, according to the data compiled by Li. Merey 16, the Venezuelan blend, was not mentioned.  ROSNEFT EXIT The arrival of Venezuelan oil in China via STS transfers continued through at least the first two months of 2020. During January and February, Chinese customs once again reported no imports of Venezuelan crude. However, nearly 130,000 barrels per day of PDVSA oil arrived at Chinese ports in those two months from seven tankers that had done STS operations, according to the Reuters review. With U.S. pressure on Venezuela rising, it is unclear whether the tactics PDVSA and its partners employed over the past year to export Venezuelan oil will remain viable. Even before it announced its complete withdrawal from Venezuela on March 28, Rosneft had not lifted any crude from the country's ports for around a month. Meanwhile, global oil prices have plunged in recent months due to a collapse in demand resulting from the spread of the novel coronavirus. Venezuela's crude output has dropped by more than 20% this year to below 700,000 barrels per day. Still, there are signs the discreet trade will continue. With few established oil companies willing to buy oil directly from Venezuela over fears of provoking Trump, two little-known Mexican firms - Libre Abordo and Schlager Business Group - recently emerged as the largest intermediaries for PDVSA crude. The companies told Reuters they had a deal with Maduro's government to supply goods, including corn and water trucks, in exchange for the oil, which they then resell. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has been investigating the two companies, among others, as part of an inquiry into possible violations of U.S. sanctions on PDVSA, according to three people familiar with the matter. The Mexican firms said swaps of goods for Venezuelan oil were permitted under U.S. sanctions as long as no cash payments reached Maduro's government. The companies said they have no knowledge of any U.S. investigation into their practices. On Feb. 11, a Panama-flagged tanker named the Athens Voyager loaded some 700,000 barrels of crude near western Venezuela's Amuay oil port, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Its customer was Libre Abordo, according to an internal PDVSA document viewed by Reuters. On Sunday, April 5, the fully loaded Athens Voyager arrived at its destination: the Linggi STS hub off the coast of Malaysia. There it pumped its cargo onto a Liberia-flagged vessel named the Loyalty A on April 17. The manager of the Athens Voyager, Greece-based Chemnav Shipmanagement Ltd, deferred comment to the vessel's owner, Marshall Islands-based Afranav Maritime Ltd. The manager of the Loyalty A, Jacinta Marine Corp of Lagos, Nigeria, did not respond to a request for comment. On June 2, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against Afranav Shipmanagement for its alleged role in trading Venezuelan oil. It said the Athens Voyager had lifted oil from Venezuelan ports as recently as mid-February. Afranav did not respond to requests for comment. Libre Abordo, meanwhile, declared bankruptcy on May 31. It said its arrangement with Venezuela had been suspended by Maduro, and that it was the target of an international pressure campaign driven by Washington. In a June 8 email to Reuters, Libre Abordo confirmed that the oil transported aboard the Athens Voyager was registered in its name. On June 10, Libre Abordo said further that the documentation of origin reflected that the crude came from Venezuela. The company said it sent the oil to Malaysia, where it was offloaded to another ship at the behest of the final customer, whose name it would not disclose. According to Refinitiv Eikon data, the receiving vessel, the Loyalty A, is currently en route to Qingdao, China.

    "[] On Thursday, the Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration's plan to repeal the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, as arbitrary and not justified. The program has protected more than 700,000 undocumented people, who were brought into the country as children, from deportation. It also allows these individuals to get work permits if they follow the program's rules and maintain a clean criminal record. We asked several DACA recipients to tell us how DACA changed their lives and what it's meant for their families and their communities. Here's what they had to say. I’m an undocumented educator and activist who arrived in the United States from Mexico at 9 months old and have since resided in Los Angeles. In third grade, I knew I wanted to be a teacher and to go to UCLA because that’s where my best teachers went. Those teachers allowed me to believe that anything was possible through education, and DACA made my aspirations legally attainable. Before DACA, there was an unsettling feeling of darkness and fear of being taken away from the only country and community I knew. Qualifying for DACA in 2013 offered me a pathway to use the knowledge and skills gained at UCLA to serve my community as an educator and role model. In my Los Angeles public school, I have been able to create a classroom where my students and their families feel seen, safe and loved. My classroom is a resource center for learning, social services and a space where students can have their needs met. We are a community that cares for and supports each other, something many of my students hadn’t experienced before my class. DACA gave me the opportunity to work in a community filled with dreams of a better life. It has allowed me to help the next generation to pursue their passions, to seek truth in the past, and to be the critical thinkers needed for a better and equitable society. I have held leadership roles and sat on committees at my school to advocate for my students and community so that they have the resources they need to thrive. DACA gave me the ability to obtain a driver’s license so that I could deliver food weekly to students most in need during the coronavirus pandemic. DACA transformed my life as an advocate and made it possible to provide for my son and my family. Though my son and many of my students are U.S. citizens, my DACA status has given them a sense of safety. Because of DACA, I’ve been able to build a more stable future, without fear of being separated from my loved ones. — Angélica Reyes, Los Angeles public high school teacher  Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, my goal was to attend college. Since becoming a DACA recipient in 2013, I’ve had a chance to work and pay for my studies at community college and UC Berkeley. After graduating, I’ve been able to help others navigate the legal system as an immigration paralegal and now as an administrator of pro bono programs at UC Berkeley School of Law. DACA allowed me to achieve some financial stability for my family and not worry about basic necessities like rent. The Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration's plan to repeal DACA, which is victory for us. But I urge my fellow DACA recipients to remember that this decision should not define us or our goals. It is our duty to advocate for everyone in the undocumented community — in particular for those who were never eligible for DACA or don’t fit the good immigrant narrative. Humane immigration policies should not be solely based on a group’s monetary contribution to the economy or what their academic achievements have been. DACA was achieved by undocumented youth who protested and pushed the Obama administration to implement it. DACA was never meant to be the solution; comprehensive immigration reform and the abolition of ICE and detention centers should be our goals. Both Democrats and Republicans have failed to create long-term solutions for the broken immigration system. Now under the Trump administration we have immigrants trapped in detention centers, threatened by a deadly pandemic. We see children separated from their parents and people fleeing for their lives being denied asylum. If one cares for the Black community, indigenous peoples, the LGBTQ community, Asians, or any other oppressed group, you will find undocumented immigrants in those communities. If DACA recipients are the only thing in people’s minds when they think of undocumented immigrants, that’s where the problem begins. — Mario Alvarado Cifuentes, pro bono administrator at UC Berkeley School of Law Since 2012, DACA has given hope and a future to thousands of young undocumented students like me. My family immigrated to California from a rural town in the Mexican state of Guanajuato when I was 12 years old. Many undocumented students never get the opportunity to complete a college degree. I obtained DACA status in 2015, and I was fortunate enough to obtain my bachelor’s degree in mathematics in 2017 from UC Riverside. DACA has provided me the opportunity to work, although I am still limited to areas of employment in engineering that do not require U.S citizenship or resident status. Thankfully, I have mentors who opened the door for me to my current position with the city of Santa Barbara. I am an engineering technician with the Department of Public Works’ water resources division, where I assist in project planning and development in the civil and environmental engineering fields. Because of DACA, I am able to gain engineering experience that will prepare me for my future profession. I am currently applying to graduate schools to obtain a PhD in environmental/chemical engineering. Obtaining a PhD in engineering would provide security for myself and my family. As an undergraduate, I had the opportunity to conduct research on DACA’s impact for the sociology department at UC Riverside. That research sought to understand how DACA changed the lives of people who wanted to attend college but could not afford to. The research results told a story that was familiar to so many undocumented students. DACA, by allowing them to work, made it possible for them to pay for school. As part of my research, I spoke with dozens of undocumented people eligible for DACA, and I found one thing to be true: DACA offered a promise for a better future, where we can contribute to a country that has raised us. — Reyna Sanchez, engineering technician, Department of Public Works, Santa Barbara My parents and I immigrated from Lima, Peru, when I was 10 years old. We moved to Chatsworth in the San Fernando Valley, and that became my new home. I received my DACA status as a sophomore attending Cal State Northridge, a couple of months after its implementation in 2012. I remember starting college before DACA or the California Dream Act and living with a lot of uncertainty, especially when thinking about a career and possible deportation. Since the creation of DACA in 2012, I completed a bachelor’s and master’s degree, and was appointed by Gov. Jerry Brown to represent students on the California State University Board of Trustees. My DACA work permit allowed me to begin a career in public service, first working as a field representative for state Sen. Bob Hertzberg. In that job, I engaged with many small businesses and community groups in the San Fernando Valley, and assisted constituents with questions or issues they had with state departments or agencies. I loved working for the people of the San Fernando Valley, a community that welcomed me as I grew up. In 2018, I moved to Sacramento to work as an Assembly fellow for Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Kevin Mullin and now as communications director for Assemblymember Monique Limón. At the state Capitol, I have a role to play in the creation of legislation that helps all Californians. DACA did not hand me any achievements, money or education. But it gave me the chance to work hard and build the future my parents have always dreamt of and sacrificed so much for. DACA gave me a sense of belonging and safety. These are things I did not have before. — Jorge Reyes Salinas, communications director for Assemblymember Monique Limón ",
    "[] WASHINGTON – Congressional Republicans unveiled a police policy package Wednesday, teeing up what could be a contentious debate with Democrats over how to address the changes demanded by many Americans in the aftermath of George Floyd's death and widespread protests over police brutality and systemic racism. Led by Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. – the chamber's lone Black Republican – the bill includes measures aimed at increasing transparency at police agencies and around use-of-force incidents while incentivizing departments to use body cameras and ban chokeholds by withholding federal grant money. \"Too often we're having a discussion in this nation about are you supporting the law enforcement community or are you supporting communities of color. This is a false binary choice,\" Scott said at a news conference unveiling his bill Wednesday. Though the legislation is likely to have broad support from Republicans and has garnered the support of the president, Democrats argued the measure does not go far enough in addressing sweeping change demanded by experts and activists. House Democrats moved forward on their own bill that would end some police practices that have been factors in high-profile deaths of Black Americans. Their plan would also take away protections that shield officers from lawsuits after misconduct. The House Judiciary Committee debated the Democratic proposal and any changes to the sweeping legislation before the chamber votes on it next week. The Senate, similarly, plans to vote on its bill next week. The chambers have yet to find a middle ground, which will be essential before any changes are signed into law by the president. More: Trump signs order addressing police misconduct, but some experts say it's not enough More: As Congress debates police reform, qualified immunity emerges as dividing issue Scott's bill would create reporting requirements on the use of deadly force by officers and the use of no-knock warrants. It addresses new training for officers and would establish a commission to study how Black men and boys are affected by a host of issues, including education and criminal justice. \"I support America, and if you support America, you support restoring the confidence that communities of color have in institutions of authority. You support America, that means you know that the overwhelming number of officers in this nation want to do their job, go home to their family. It is not a binary choice,\" he said. Scott and others have acknowledged that although there are clear differences in legislation pursued by Republicans and Democrats, both parties have interest in tackling the issue of chokeholds and requiring more data from police departments. Bills by both parties have included a mandate that would make lynching a federal crime. The biggest hurdle has been the issue of qualified immunity, the protection that shields police and other public officials from lawsuits if accused of misconduct. The issue has been one of the changes sought by Democrats and one of the few that Republicans have dubbed a nonstarter. Scott called the issue a \"poison pill\" for any police bills – the White House has voiced opposition to it – but said he and other Republicans are open to hearing alternatives on the issue of holding police officers accountable. \"We fully support the Scott bill and every element of it,\" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Wednesday afternoon. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., applauded Scott's work at Wednesday's news conference and said the Senate would consider the measure next week. He encouraged Senate Democrats to back the legislation rather than \"just sparring back and forth.\" The goal is to create a law and move forward in a bipartisan fashion, he said. \"Sen. Scott has made it possible for those of us in the Senate Republican conference who are not African American to understand that this problem still exists,\" McConnell said. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the legislation will need \"dramatic improvement.\" \"The Senate Republican proposal on policing does not rise to the moment,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. The \"greatest flaw\" in the Republicans' bill, Schumer said, is that it is \"missing real, meaningful accountability for individual officers' misconduct.\" \"As we continue to review the Republican legislation,\" he said, \"I will be talking to my caucus about the best way to strengthen it.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the bill \"inadequate\" compared with the proposals offered by Democrats, but she hoped to work \"in a bipartisan way to pass legislation that creates meaningful change.\" Democrats had similar criticism on an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Tuesday that established new standards for the use of force by police officers. The order called for the creation of a national database to allow departments to track potential hires with records of abuse and for mental health professionals to respond alongside officers to calls dealing with homelessness, drug addiction and mental illness. The order did not include a ban on chokeholds as many activists demanded but says the police tactic should be used only if lives are in danger. 'Make it stop': George Floyd's brother Philonise urges Congress to 'do the right thing' More: Democrats unveil sweeping police bill, honor George Floyd with 8 minutes, 46 seconds of silence The House's bill, which was led by the Congressional Black Caucus, not only would end qualified immunity but also aims to bolster police accountability and end the practice of officers with problematic records moving from one department to another by creating a national registry. It would end certain police practices, such as the use of no-knock warrants and chokeholds. Republicans plan to introduce a host of amendments on the bill, launching the House's first discussion on how to address police changes after Floyd's death. House Democrats and Republicans agree that changes are needed but got into heated debates over the Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter movements. \"Mr. (Philonise) Floyd charged us with making sure that his brother’s death would not be in vain, and he pleaded with us to turn this pain and anger that we all feel into meaningful change,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said at the opening of Wednesday's hearing, noting the emotional testimony by Floyd's brother last week before the panel. \"His words echoed the voices of millions of Americans who have taken to the streets in the last few weeks to demand justice and to demand action. \"Today, we answer their call.\" Contributing: Nicholas Wu This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Sen. Tim Scott unveils GOP police bill that would discourage chokeholds",
    "[] Six years ago, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz says, he met the young boy he now calls his son. Nestor Galban was 12 and had just arrived from Cuba, where he’d grown up and where his mother had recently died of breast cancer, Gaetz says. Then a state legislator, Gaetz was dating Nestor’s older sister. And so Nestor moved in with them — “a modern family,” Gaetz says now. He says that, except for an interruption during Nestor’s junior year after Gaetz and Nestor’s sister broke up, Nestor has basically lived with him since moving from Cuba. “He is a part of my family story,” Gaetz, 38, tells PEOPLE, adding: “My work with Nestor, our family, no element of my public service could compare to the joy that our family has brought me.” Geatz did not formally adopt Nestor (and he declines to discuss Nestor’s relationship with his biological family now). He re-frames the matter, saying, “Our relationship as a family is defined by our love for each other, not by any paperwork.” Nestor, he says, “is my son in every conceivable way, and I can’t imagine loving him any more if he was my own flesh and blood.” Recalling those early days with Nestor — including a scene he paints of the two playing catch not long after the boy arrived to the U.S. — Gaetz warns that he might start to choke up. “I just think that it’s been the greatest thing in my life that this young man has been a part of my family,” he says, “and going forward I look forward to being his biggest cheerleader.” Perhaps the strangest thing about this story is that this is the first time any of it has been shared publicly. On Thursday, Gaetz tweeted a photo of himself and Nestor, announcing that he’d been parenting the 19-year-old for years. \"I am so proud of him and raising him has been the best, most rewarding thing I’ve done in my life,\" he wrote before biting back at a Democratic congressman he had argued with at a hearing the day before over policing and raising kids of color. “As you can imagine, I was triggered when (to make an absurd debate point) a fellow congressman diminished the contributions of Republicans because we don’t raise non-white kids,” he wrote. “Well, I have.\" The second-term Republican congressman from Florida's Panhandle had not publicly identified himself as a father before this week and his office has said that he did not have kids. His announcement drew widespread surprise and, in many left-leaning circles, much criticism. (It was also rapidly meme'd.) Nestor Galban/Instagram From left: Donald Trump Jr., Nestor Galban and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz Detractors said Gaetz had turned the teenager into a prop; others called it a dismissive slight-of-hand — like shrugging off accusations of prejudice by pointing to personal friendships with people of color. Many pointed to his views on immigration more broadly. In a characteristic slam, one user tweeted: “Matt Gaetz using Nestor to score political points or to show he is not racist is disgusting.” In other corners of social media, conspiratorial theories began tangling together about Nestor’s biography and his biological relatives. None of that fazes Gaetz. “I haven’t responded to it there and feel no need to respond to it now,” he says of the social media discussion about Nestor. “My son and I owe no explanation about our family to the blue-checkmark brigade.” “I don’t really live in the minds of others,” says the lawmaker who earlier this year made headlines for wearing a gas mask on the floor of the House of Representatives, in the early days of the novel coronavirus pandemic. “I live for the values and principles that matter to my constituents and that I’ve been raised with.” He says he was motivated to speak out about Nestor because, in his view, he was being unfairly maligned after his viral argument with Democratic Rep. Cedric Richmond at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday. Richmond had been discussing the need for police reform and the \"imminent threat\" of police to black men. “People are dying as we talk. I am not interested in moving at a snail's pace. I’m not interested in a watered-down bill that mandates nothing,” he said. Afterward, Gaetz said that he \"appreciate[d] your passion\" but then asked Richmond if he was saying none of the other representatives had non-white kids. (Richmond had referred to his own son.) Richmond snapped back that he wouldn't be \"sidetracked about the color of our children .... It is about black males, black people in the streets that are getting killed. And if one of them happens to be your kid, I'm concerned about him, too. And clearly I'm more concerned about him than you are.\" \"Excuse me, you're claiming you're more concerned for my family than I do?\" Gaetz replied, voice rising to a yell. \"Who in the hell do you think you are?\" Richmond later shot back: \"Was that a nerve?\" The exchange, Gaetz says now, “made me want to get up and rip his head off.” For years, Gaetz says he maintained Nestor’s privacy. But that, he insists, “is very different than suggesting I was hiding him.” “Just imagine: You’re 12 years old, your mom has just died, you’re learning English as you’re trying to get your footing in school. It just wasn’t the right time in middle school and high school to subject him to politics,” Gaetz says now. Erin Gaetz/Twitter Nestor Galban (left) and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz in 2013 Matt Gaetz/Twitter Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz (left) and Nestor Galban Of the incredulous responses he’s received from users who point back to a March 2016 photo in which Gaetz refers to Nestor as a “local student” or a 2017 Facebook video Gaetz recorded for constituents with Nestor sitting in the background in which he calls Nestor his “helper” (seeming almost to catch himself on an S-sounding word first), Gaetz says: “I felt like coming to the country, dealing with the death of a mother, learning English and enduring the normal trials and tribulations of high school and middle school were enough on the young man’s plate.” Now, however, Gaetz says that Nestor is ready: “He’s very eager to be identified as my son as publicly as people will accept it.” Gaetz says his bond with Nestor has been known in his Florida community and among his social circle, including on Capitol Hill: “My friends know I have a son. The people who go to church with me know I have a son, my fellow soccer parents know I have a son.” (He says Nestor was his “best door-knocker” during his 2016 congressional campaign: “Nestor was very persuasive at getting people to accept Matt Gaetz yard signs.”) On Twitter, former California Rep. Katie Hill, a Democrat, spoke out in defense of Gaetz’s revelation that he’s been secretly parenting a teenager. \"Many of you know @mattgaetz & I have an unlikely friendship. I can’t stand a lot of his beliefs but he’s been there for me when others haven’t,\" she wrote. \"He talks about Nestor more than anything, has done so much for his son & is truly a proud dad.\" Detailing the timeline, Gaetz tells PEOPLE Nestor lived with him for around four years after first arriving in Cuba before going to Miami for his junior year and living with his biological father: “Then he turned 18 [and] it was easier for him to just move back with me.” (Gaetz declines to specify when exactly he and Nestor's older sister broke up.) Elsewhere in the interview, he describes the sequence of events this way: “There was a time period at the beginning of my service in Congress where, based on his age and other circumstances, it was not tenable for him to live with me.\" With his own Twitter account, Nestor has been wading into the reaction online.

But now I’m 19 and I old enough to handle it.\" Briefly speaking with PEOPLE while on the phone with Gaetz, Nestor says: “Matt is not my biological father, but he raised me as his own son when I came from Cuba after my mother’s death.” “He’s always been a role model in my life,” Nestor says, rattling off a quick list of lessons learned: baseball, cooking, English. (“I taught him some Spanish, too.”) Nestor, Gaetz says, has taught him patience — the kind any parent learns. \"Of course,\" he also says, \"my views on race are informed by the fact that I have been raising a non-white child.\" \"I’ve had ‘the talk’ with Nestor about how to interact with law enforcement,\" he says. \"It’s probably a different talk than I would have had if I had a white son.\" Erin Gaetz/Twitter The Gaetz family with Nestor Galban (right) Erin Gaetz/Twitter Nestor Galban Gaetz's sister, Erin, tweeted on Thursday as well. She shared family photos of Nestor through the years, including of his high school graduation earlier this year, him on Christmas Eve in 2013 and him with Gaetz and his grandmother and grandfather. (Nestor posted the same photo on Instagram in 2018 with the caption “Grandma’s Boys.”) In the fall, Nestor will start at Troy University in Alabama, where he plans to study nursing. The distance, Gaetz says, is “far enough away and still close enough.” Their first parent-student visit to the campus is in three weeks, Gaetz says. “I want to study nursing because I like helping people and I think every day being able to save people’s lives and being able to heal people and take care of them makes me happy,” Nestor says. Also: He really likes science. “We’ve talked about the fact that college is the time in your life when you have the most free time but you can have some of the most daring consequences if you don’t manage it well,” Gaetz says. He describes Nestor as a “star soccer player,” a jokester and a charmer — a “ham” — with a love of sports and, in his telling, a kind of amiable wryness. A teenager, in other words. “And as I’ve talked to him throughout the day,” Gaetz says, “he’s very taken by the fact that he has a lot more followers on social media now.”",
    "[] Six years ago, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz says, he met the young boy he now calls his son. Nestor Galban was 12 and had just arrived from Cuba, where he’d grown up and where his mother had recently died of breast cancer, Gaetz says. Then a state legislator, Gaetz was dating Nestor’s older sister. And so Nestor moved in with them — “a modern family,” Gaetz says now. He says that, except for an interruption during Nestor’s junior year after Gaetz and Nestor’s sister broke up, Nestor has basically lived with him since moving from Cuba. “He is a part of my family story,” Gaetz, 38, tells PEOPLE, adding: “My work with Nestor, our family, no element of my public service could compare to the joy that our family has brought me.” Geatz did not formally adopt Nestor (and he declines to discuss Nestor’s relationship with his biological family now). He re-frames the matter, saying, “Our relationship as a family is defined by our love for each other, not by any paperwork.” Nestor, he says, “is my son in every conceivable way, and I can’t imagine loving him any more if he was my own flesh and blood.” Recalling those early days with Nestor — including a scene he paints of the two playing catch not long after the boy arrived to the U.S. — Gaetz warns that he might start to choke up. “I just think that it’s been the greatest thing in my life that this young man has been a part of my family,” he says, “and going forward I look forward to being his biggest cheerleader.” Perhaps the strangest thing about this story is that this is the first time any of it has been shared publicly. On Thursday, Gaetz tweeted a photo of himself and Nestor, announcing that he’d been parenting the 19-year-old for years. \"I am so proud of him and raising him has been the best, most rewarding thing I’ve done in my life,\" he wrote before biting back at a Democratic congressman he had argued with at a hearing the day before over policing and raising kids of color. “As you can imagine, I was triggered when (to make an absurd debate point) a fellow congressman diminished the contributions of Republicans because we don’t raise non-white kids,” he wrote. “Well, I have.\" The second-term Republican congressman from Florida's Panhandle had not publicly identified himself as a father before this week and his office has said that he did not have kids. His announcement drew widespread surprise and, in many left-leaning circles, much criticism. (It was also rapidly meme'd.) Nestor Galban/Instagram From left: Donald Trump Jr., Nestor Galban and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz Detractors said Gaetz had turned the teenager into a prop; others called it a dismissive slight-of-hand — like shrugging off accusations of prejudice by pointing to personal friendships with people of color. Many pointed to his views on immigration more broadly. In a characteristic slam, one user tweeted: “Matt Gaetz using Nestor to score political points or to show he is not racist is disgusting.” In other corners of social media, conspiratorial theories began tangling together about Nestor’s biography and his biological relatives. None of that fazes Gaetz. “I haven’t responded to it there and feel no need to respond to it now,” he says of the social media discussion about Nestor. “My son and I owe no explanation about our family to the blue-checkmark brigade.” “I don’t really live in the minds of others,” says the lawmaker who earlier this year made headlines for wearing a gas mask on the floor of the House of Representatives, in the early days of the novel coronavirus pandemic. “I live for the values and principles that matter to my constituents and that I’ve been raised with.” He says he was motivated to speak out about Nestor because, in his view, he was being unfairly maligned after his viral argument with Democratic Rep. Cedric Richmond at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday. Richmond had been discussing the need for police reform and the \"imminent threat\" of police to black men. “People are dying as we talk. I am not interested in moving at a snail's pace. I’m not interested in a watered-down bill that mandates nothing,” he said. Afterward, Gaetz said that he \"appreciate[d] your passion\" but then asked Richmond if he was saying none of the other representatives had non-white kids. (Richmond had referred to his own son.) Richmond snapped back that he wouldn't be \"sidetracked about the color of our children .... It is about black males, black people in the streets that are getting killed. And if one of them happens to be your kid, I'm concerned about him, too. And clearly I'm more concerned about him than you are.\" \"Excuse me, you're claiming you're more concerned for my family than I do?\" Gaetz replied, voice rising to a yell. \"Who in the hell do you think you are?\" Richmond later shot back: \"Was that a nerve?\" The exchange, Gaetz says now, “made me want to get up and rip his head off.” For years, Gaetz says he maintained Nestor’s privacy. But that, he insists, “is very different than suggesting I was hiding him.” “Just imagine: You’re 12 years old, your mom has just died, you’re learning English as you’re trying to get your footing in school. It just wasn’t the right time in middle school and high school to subject him to politics,” Gaetz says now. Erin Gaetz/Twitter Nestor Galban (left) and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz in 2013 Matt Gaetz/Twitter Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz (left) and Nestor Galban Of the incredulous responses he’s received from users who point back to a March 2016 photo in which Gaetz refers to Nestor as a “local student” or a 2017 Facebook video Gaetz recorded for constituents with Nestor sitting in the background in which he calls Nestor his “helper” (seeming almost to catch himself on an S-sounding word first), Gaetz says: “I felt like coming to the country, dealing with the death of a mother, learning English and enduring the normal trials and tribulations of high school and middle school were enough on the young man’s plate.” Now, however, Gaetz says that Nestor is ready: “He’s very eager to be identified as my son as publicly as people will accept it.” Gaetz says his bond with Nestor has been known in his Florida community and among his social circle, including on Capitol Hill: “My friends know I have a son. The people who go to church with me know I have a son, my fellow soccer parents know I have a son.” (He says Nestor was his “best door-knocker” during his 2016 congressional campaign: “Nestor was very persuasive at getting people to accept Matt Gaetz yard signs.”) On Twitter, former California Rep. Katie Hill, a Democrat, spoke out in defense of Gaetz’s revelation that he’s been secretly parenting a teenager. \"Many of you know @mattgaetz & I have an unlikely friendship. I can’t stand a lot of his beliefs but he’s been there for me when others haven’t,\" she wrote. \"He talks about Nestor more than anything, has done so much for his son & is truly a proud dad.\" Detailing the timeline, Gaetz tells PEOPLE Nestor lived with him for around four years after first arriving in Cuba before going to Miami for his junior year and living with his biological father: “Then he turned 18 [and] it was easier for him to just move back with me.” (Gaetz declines to specify when exactly he and Nestor's older sister broke up.) Elsewhere in the interview, he describes the sequence of events this way: “There was a time period at the beginning of my service in Congress where, based on his age and other circumstances, it was not tenable for him to live with me.\" With his own Twitter account, Nestor has been wading into the reaction online. He tweeted back at another user on Thursday: \"I wanted as a secret before because I wanted to have a normal life without any of y’all getting in it. But now I’m 19 and I old enough to handle it.\" Briefly speaking with PEOPLE while on the phone with Gaetz, Nestor says: “Matt is not my biological father, but he raised me as his own son when I came from Cuba after my mother’s death.” “He’s always been a role model in my life,” Nestor says, rattling off a quick list of lessons learned: baseball, cooking, English.

    "[] If you’re a conservative, upon hearing the news that the Supreme Court ruled in Bostock v. Clayton County that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 — which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex — covers discrimination on the basis of gender identity (and sexual orientation), you’d likely assume that the Court simply endorsed a radically revisionist view according to which your sex is entirely determined by, or identical with, your gender identity. But this was not the basis of the Court’s decision. Rather, Neil Gorsuch, writing for the majority, based the Court’s ruling on the claim that discrimination on the basis of gender identity (and sexual orientation) necessarily involves discrimination on the basis of sex. Accordingly, if discrimination on the basis of sex is made illegal by the Civil Rights Act, so is discrimination on the basis of gender identity (and sexual orientation). He writes: An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids. Tiana Lowe is correct when she notes that this ruling actually depends on the legitimacy of the biological definition of sex: To be clear, the court could deliver one of greatest legal protections for gay and transgender workers specifically because it acknowledges a fact deemed heretical by the most vocal woke activists: Namely that biological sex is real. For years, the wokes have attempted to cancel everyone from right-wing trolls to liberal scientists for pointing out that biological sex is a scientific reality, one that specifically validates gay and transgender folks as a distinct class. And now the court has decided that because of that distinction, they’re a protected class. Transphobia used to mean refusing to address someone by their preferred pronouns or denying their gender identity. Now, it’s morphed into meaning that you acknowledge that transgender males are “transgender” precisely because they were born biological females. But today’s SCOTUS ruling proves that bifurcating the meaning of biological sex from gender identity is specifically what confers special protections onto gay and transgender workers. In short, Gorsuch’s reasoning requires that we consider transgender persons to be the sex that they were “assigned at birth,” not the sex with which they identify. However, this reasoning leads to a difficult dilemma when it comes to applying Bostock to businesses that enforce sex-specific policies, such as sex-specific dress codes. The Court assumes that their decision applies in R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. EEOC, a case involving a business with a sex-specific dress code. In that case, Stephens, a biologically male employee, transitioned and began to live as a woman. Accordingly, she began to dress in the attire required by the Harris Funeral Home for female employees. Stephens was then fired for refusing to dress in the attire required by the business for male employees. At NRO, Dan McLaughlin argues that the Court must assume that Stephens is a woman in order for the decision to apply to Harris. Thus, it turns out that the Court is, in fact, re-defining “woman” in the course of its decision — it’s just guilty of an “unwillingness to say out loud the reasoning of its decision about who is a man and who is a woman”: In Harris, a funeral home had separate dress codes for men and women; a biological male (Stephens) began “living as a woman” and was fired for dressing as a woman. Under Gorsuch’s reasoning, this would qualify as sex discrimination because a woman would not be fired for dressing as a woman. But that assumes that the Court has decided whether Stephens is a woman, which of course is the entire question in debate in arguments about the legal and social status of transgenderism. In fact, Stephens contends that Stephens is not a man. The Harris Funeral Home enforced its dress code against Stephens not to discriminate against women dressing as women, but because it believed that Stephens was a man. The Court’s decision assumes that this is a decision that can be punished — an assumption that would have made no sense at the time the statutory term “sex” was written, in 1964. But this is mistaken. If Stephens is assumed to be a woman, then discrimination on the basis of gender identity actually passes the Gorsuch test: Stephens would no longer be a man who is fired for doing something (dressing in the attire required of female employees) that a woman would not be fired for doing. Instead, Stephens would be a woman who is fired for doing something that other women are not fired for doing. And Bostock does not offer protection from discrimination on the basis of one’s “trans status” as such — on being a trans woman rather than a cis woman. However, McLaughlin comes close to detecting the real problematic implication of this ruling: If this reasoning applies to Harris, it’s very hard to see how it doesn’t apply to all cases in which an individual is fired for defying a sex-specific dress code (or any other sex-specific policy), whether a trans person is involved or not. McLaughlin’s drag-queen case is case in point. If Bostock protects a trans person who violates a sex-specific dress code, then it’s hard to see how it doesn’t also protect a drag-queen who chooses to cross-dress for reasons other than trans-related gender expression. Indeed, it’s hard to see how Bostock doesn’t protect anyone who chooses to defy a sex-specific dress code (or other sex-specific policy) for any reason. If Stephens cannot be fired for dressing in the attire required of female employees — because that is something a woman would not be fired for doing — how can any man (and the ruling assumes that he is a man!), trans or not, be fired for dressing in the attire required of female employees? As McLaughlin notes, Gorsuch explicitly denies that Bostock covers cases involving sex-specific dress codes, bathrooms, and the like: The employers worry that our decision will sweep beyond Title VII to other federal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination. And, under Title VII itself, they say sex-segregated bathrooms, locker rooms, and dress codes will prove unsustainable after our decision today. But none of these other laws are before us; we have not had the benefit of adversarial testing about the meaning of their terms, and we do not prejudge any such question today. Under Title VII, too, we do not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of the kind. McLaughlin calls this “disingenuous,” given that Harris was before the Court. I call it a dilemma: Either Bostock protects Stephens, a trans person who violated the Harris Funeral Home’s sex-specific dress code, in which case it protects anyone who violates a sex-specific dress code or policy (whether they are trans or not), or else Bostock does not apply to firings related to violations of sex-specific dress codes at all, in which case it does not apply to Harris. The Court cannot have it both ways. The Emperor’s New Law The Supreme Court Decides Who Is a Woman Trolling Is a Terrible Way to Write Laws",
    "[] Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Former national security adviser John Bolton claims that President Donald Trump said it would be \"cool\" to invade Venezuela. Trump made the statement because he believes the nation is \"really part of the United States,\" Bolton writes in his upcoming book, \"In The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir.\" According to The Washington Post, which published some excerpts from the book, Trump also confused the current and former presidents of Afghanistan. Bolton also writes that Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping that Americans wanted him to amend the Constitution to allow him to serve more than two terms. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. President Donald Trump claimed that it would be \"cool\" to invade Venezuela because the nation was \"really part of the United States,\" according to a new book by former national security adviser John Bolton. In his book, \"In The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,\" the former national security adviser also claims that Trump kept confusing the current and former presidents of Afghanistan and asked Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to help him reach an agreement with Iran. In 2019, Trump expressed he would consider an outright quarantine or blockade of Venezuela in an effort to dispose of President Nicolas Maduro's authoritarian reign over the country. As Venezuela faced an economic crash and political turmoil, Maduro has been accused of rigging the country's presidential elections and is not recognized by the US and many other nations. The US State Department offered a $15 million reward for his arrest. \"We seek a peaceful transition to power,\" Trump said in 2019. \"But all options are on the table.\" In a separate meeting at the Oval Office in 2018, Trump reportedly asked aides why the US could not invade Venezuela, according to senior officials. National security adviser H.R. McMaster, who immediately preceeded Bolton's tenure, was reportedly present in the meeting. McMaster and other officials attempted to convince Trump that military action was tenuous and unpredictable. NICOLAS ASFOURI/AFP/Getty Images The US president also told Chinese President Xi Jinping that Americans wanted him to amend the Constitution to allow him to serve more than two terms, Bolton writes. And in another section, Bolton alleges that Trump \"pleaded\" with Xi to buy US agricultural products to help him win reelection this year. Bolton's book is set to be released on June 23, but on Tuesday, the Trump administration sued the former national security adviser to prevent him from releasing the book. The lawsuit against Bolton accuses him of breaking his contract by backing out of the National Security Council's ongoing vetting process to determine whether Bolton's book contains classified information that needs to be redacted or edited down. The NSC \"quickly identified significant quantities of classified information that it asked Defendant to remove,\" the complaint said. \"An iterative process between NSC Staff and Defendant then began, as required by the binding agreements he signed, with changes to the book and other information being securely passed between Defendant and NSC staff. Soon, though, Defendant apparently became dissatisfied at the pace of NSC's review.\" It alleges that instead of waiting for the process to conclude, Bolton \"decided to take matters into his own hands.\" On June 7, \"without Defendant giving any prior notice to the NSC, press reports revealed that Defendant and his publisher had resolved to release the book on June 23, without completing the pre-publication review process,\" the lawsuit said.

    "[] To the editor: Our ill-conceived and poorly executed immigration laws epitomize our political divisiveness. That successive presidential administrations have failed to bring the parties together on this issue highlights the government's inability to solve major problems. (\"With its DACA decision, the Supreme Court makes it clear Congress must fix this,\" editorial, June 18) Because of our failure to enact a viable policy and legally admit necessary workers, we have millions of people who came illegally and provided necessary labor but were denied wage and benefit protections. During the pandemic they have been on the front lines in hospitals and the food industry. They and the young children they brought here do not deserve to live in constant fear and underprivilege. We need to provide a path for legalization and citizenship. On the other hand, our borders have been too porous for decades. We need to better define our laws and provide an adequate system of speedy adjudication. I legally immigrated as a child with my parents. We waited five years to get our visas. For people living with the yoke of illegality, the opportunities that my parents and I enjoyed are far more dream than reality. We can solve this if we only try. Michael Telerant, Los Angeles .. To the editor: The Supreme Court has spoken. California can continue to \"not help\" federal immigration officers. That, however, does not mean the federal government has to stop enforcing immigration law. It will just be harder and therefore more costly. By making enforcement more costly, other states will help bear the increased cost of apprehension and deportation. That is not fair. The federal government should seek to recover this increased cost from California and other states. Since a separate tax is not feasible, the most fair way is to reduce federal money going to local law enforcement. California and other sanctuary governments should put forth a statement on what type of immigration policy they would support. Do they favor open borders? Unless they do, some enforcement is necessary. Rich Malone, Rancho Cucamonga .. To the editor: The Los Angeles Times Editorial Board has become very forthright in calling out President Trump's illogic and inhumanity. It should do the same for Congress. The Times says that Congress' failure to enact immigration reform \"is a testament to its dysfunction.\" On the contrary, Republicans in Congress have been quite successful in achieving many of their goals, including enacting huge tax breaks for the wealthy and filling the judiciary with staunch conservatives. They are also very effective at obstruction, and the failure to enact comprehensive immigration reform is a prime example. It should be made more plain that it's the Democrats in Congress who are fighting to save the U.S. Postal Service and fending off cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Democrats are no saints, but there is a distinct difference between the two parties, and they should not be painted with the same brush. Grace Bertalot, Anaheim",

    "[] In the Lancaster, Penn., courtyard where Joe Biden met with families who say they've benefited from the Affordable Care Act, loud, opposing chants could be heard. \"Four more years\" and \"USA\" were being shouted by supporters of President Donald  Trump. Louder calls came from supporters of the Black Lives Matters movement: \"No justice, no peace, no racist police.\" The groups outside were less than 100 yards away from the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. They were out of sight, but their message was heard. Biden, who was in southcentral Pennsylvania Thursday to talk to Lancaster County families about health care, didn't discuss what was going on outside. Instead, he focused on health care policy and the incumbent he's running against in November. The former vice president said Trump's “twin legacies” are the “failure to protect the American people from coronavirus” and his “heartless crusade” to overturn the Affordable Care Act. “The president wants us to believe there’s a choice between the economy and public health. Amazingly, he still hasn’t grasped the most basic fact of this crisis. To fix the economy, we have to get control over the virus,\" Biden said. Biden met with three Pennsylvania families: Stacie Ritter, a Lancaster resident whose 22-year-old twins were diagnosed with cancer at the age of 4. Victoria Salerno, a Chester resident whose 4-year-old son has mitochondrial disease. Amy Raslevich, a Pittsburgh resident who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017. She is the mother of two children, Laura and Sam, who each have celiac disease. They all described scenarios in which they would not have afforded the treatment they needed without President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul in 2010. “We could have very easily been a family that was bankrupt,\" Raslevich said. Salerno said her son, Cole, requires a special tube in his heart to survive mitochondrial disease. It costs $80,000 per month. The Affordable Care Act enabled her family to qualify for Medicaid to pay for life-saving treatment. Without it, her family was looking at bankruptcy, she said. Ritter said she was also going bankrupt until the Affordable Care Act made it possible to use Medicaid benefits to pay for her twins' cancer treatments. “One of the reasons I voted for you and President Obama in 2007 was he understood what it was like. My mom died of cancer at 52 years of age,” she said. “She put off going for care because she couldn’t afford it. By the time she went, it was too late. I knew after reading President Obama’s plan, he got it because of his mom.” Biden leaned forward as he listened during his fourth visit to Pennsylvania this month. The courtyard conversation came while Trump's case to end the Obama-era healthcare plan is before the U.S. Supreme Court. \"I don’t think people really fully understand that there’s 100 million people with pre-existing conditions,\" Biden said. \"If the president wins this case, he keeps saying he’ll cover pre-existing conditions, but he hasn’t figured out any way it’s possible to do that absent what we’ve done.” Ritter said she didn’t understand why Trump wanted to overturn the Affordable Care Act. “Well, I don’t get it either,” Biden said. “The fact is ... the reason everybody kinda forgets why we allowed people to say on their parents plan until age 26 was because of the financial crisis, a whole generation lost access to good jobs, access to insurance. It made a gigantic difference for people.” While Biden was in Pennsylvania, Trump was in Wisconsin. Many contrasts can be drawn between the presumptive 2020 presidential nominees, but Biden and Trump both have chosen to focus their in-person campaign efforts in states that can help them win in November. \"It's battleground state time,\" said Terry Madonna, a pollster and political analyst at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster. Biden is visiting his native Pennsylvania for more than the easy proximity to his home state of Delaware, Madonna said. The former vice president on June 2 delivered a speech in Philadelphia, on June 11 attended a roundtable in Philadelphia and on June 17 gave a speech in Darby. \"He's been here three times in June. That shows the importance of Pennsylvania. It's one of the top states that will determine the next president,\" Madonna said. Trump won Pennsylvania by 44,000 votes in 2016 and was the first Republican presidential nominee to win the state since George H.W. Bush in 1988. When Democratic presidential nominee and frontrunner Hillary Clinton lost Pennsylvania in 2016, she was criticized for focusing too much on Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. She made a few campaign stops in Harrisburg, but Clinton largely concentrated on the highly populated bookends of the state.

Democrats seemed to have learned lessons of the past with Biden's visit to Lancaster County, Madonna said. \"Lancaster is still a Republican county to be sure, but overall Democrats have done better there and in southcentral Pennsylvania in recent years,\" he said. Biden has a 6-point lead in Pennsylvania, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls. \"Biden's lead has grown in the battleground states, but his lead is not insurmountable,\" Madonna said. Whatever inroads Biden can make in traditionally red counties like Lancaster will help him in November, he said. \"Democrats hope to cut down on the Republican edge,\" Madonna said. A month ago, Biden's lead was 3 points ahead of Trump in Pennsylvania. Trump lost footing because of \"his reaction to police reform and the George Floyd murder case,\" Madonna said. Black Lives Matter protesters held their ground on the street in front of the Lancaster Recreation Center as about a dozen police officers lined up in front of the building where Biden met with families. The protesters demanded Biden come out and speak to them, intermittently chanting “No justice, no peace.” A Lancaster County couple wearing Trump MAGA hats debated a few of the Black Lives Matter protesters who asked them to explain themselves. “What is your purpose for standing in front of a school for children saying you support Trump?” one woman asked them. “He’s doing good things,” Robert Reed, a Lancaster resident said. “The Dixie flag is equal to the Nazi flag,” another woman said. Reed didn’t see a connection between Trump and racism, defending the president’s successes with Black employment and reduction of taxes. “What happened with (George) Floyd is wrong, dead wrong,” Reed told one protester who had thought the police presence in the city was an effort to protect white Trump supporters. He said he didn’t know Biden was in the city. Before they left for home, Reed and his wife shook a few hands. The protest went on. At one point, protestors laid on the ground with their hands behind their backs, the position Floyd was in when he died. Peg Rettew-Cross live-streamed the scene from her yard, just a half block from the rec center. She has lived there for 20 years. “I think it’s wonderful ... they can express their feelings in a way they want to,” she said. “Any and all lives matter. I’m just sure glad Biden is here because he will listen to them.” Candy Woodall is a reporter for the USA Today Network. She can be reached at 717-480-1783 or on Twitter at @candynotcandace.

    "[] As the United States faces its biggest crisis over civil rights in decades, Congress is poised to do nothing. Again. What could have been a searing, soul-searching moment where America’s political leaders helped establish a new national accord on race and the role of police in society has instead devolved into a frenzy of political posturing, campaign sloganeering and ugly partisan fights. The House on Thursday passed a sweeping police reform bill that would ban chokeholds, end the use of “no-knock” warrants, create a national registry for officers accused of misconduct, and make it easier to prosecute officers. Yet Democrats picked up only a few GOP votes, guaranteeing the proposal has no chance of moving in the Senate. And the Senate can’t even agree to begin debate on a police reform bill, with Democrats blocking efforts to take up a proposal drafted by Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.), one of two Black Republicans on Capitol Hill. “It’s really unfortunate,” Scott said. “You’d like to think that we’re all willing to get together on something as consequential as police reform in a moment like this.” Rather than restart their efforts to find a solution, party leaders are pointing fingers at the other, suggesting Washington's latest attempt at reform is all but finished. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other GOP senators were infuriated when Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Republicans are “trying to get away with murder, actually. The murder of George Floyd.” They demanded she apologize. Pelosi refused. Then Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) angered Democrats when he suggested Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) had “a chokehold” on the Republicans’ version of police reform. Democrats said that comment showed GOP leaders weren’t serious about addressing the issue of police brutality. Things aren’t much better down Pennsylvania Avenue. The White House didn’t make any effort to broker a compromise; instead, senior aides whipped House Republicans against the Democratic bill, according to GOP sources. President Donald Trump, trailing badly in the polls, has turned to repeatedly tweeting out “Law and Order!,” a clear sign that he isn’t interested in anything Democrats were proposing. The president instead has threatened to use “overwhelming force” to end protests, urged “long-term prison sentences” for anyone caught tearing down statues, and accused the country’s first Black president of “treason.” Eric Trump, the president’s son, called Black Lives Matter protesters “animals” at a rally last week, to cheers from the crowd. It’s a level of nastiness between the two sides that’s become common in the Trump era, grinding non-essential legislative work to a halt and sapping any energy to move big bills, be it on immigration and infrastructure, or gun control and policing. The exception, of course, was the trillions of dollars that Congress approved this spring to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and stave off an economic meltdown — dual crises that forced both sides into rare bipartisan action. Although that, too, only came after weeks of theatrics from both parties. And with the explosive issue of police brutality and racism, what little opportunity there was for compromise quickly faded. “It’s bad,” said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.). “The last three and a half years, the president’s tried to divide this country and he’s done a pretty effective job of it, and he’s divided the Democrats and Republicans to almost a toxic environment.” “There’s not one single conversation between a Democratic member and a Republican member in order to achieve a bipartisan bill in the House,” complained Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.). “At this moment of a presidential election year, a divided America, an economy in chaos, the health crisis, and layer on top of that we can’t physically be with one another to work things out, it makes the outcome this screwed up and awful.” In the days after Floyd’s murder in Minneapolis, there seemed to be an opening for real action — a groundswell moment that would force Democrats and Republicans to set aside their differences and deliver something to a restive and angry American public. But in recent weeks, the prospect of a bipartisan compromise has dissipated. Each party has refused to amend their version of the bill, even as they deliver soaring speeches from the House and Senate floor about the need for action and show up to demonstrations talking about getting something done. “We’re just going to sit here and take shots across the building with a Senate bill and a House bill and no resolution. And then we’re going to fly home tomorrow,” said Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas). “In what universe is that the right thing to do?” For many senior lawmakers — particularly Black members who led this fight for decades — it’s exactly what they were afraid would happen from the beginning. “My fear was that we might end up in a stalemate over significant legislation, maybe some of the most important legislation to come to the floor in my 15 years,” said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), a former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. “What I hope the American public will understand is that follow-through matters as it relates to credibility,” Cleaver added. Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.), another member of the CBC whose district has erupted in protests in recent weeks added: “It doesn't matter if you have the best bill in the world if it never gets passed.” Frustrated rank-and-file members say they cast blame in both parties, with senior Republicans and Democrats working on their own separate tracks from the start. And it has infuriated many of the freshmen who rode a wave in 2018 vowing to end the Washington gridlock. Many lawmakers left town after the House vote on Thursday disappointed in the failure to act and worried about how the country will react to the breakdown. “It’s just too important to simply pass and move on to the next item. This is what we’re here for,” Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who has frequently lamented that leaders of both parties don’t work toward consensus. “It’s always been my expectation, and frankly, dream, that [bipartisanship] starts in the very beginning But I think we do it in reverse here, too often.” “It’s kind of symptomatic of what’s wrong with this place in general, and that’s kind of evolved over a long period of time,” added Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.). Yet Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), the CBC chairwoman who led the effort on the House Democratic bill, still believes that some kind of deal can be reached. “We’ll be talking, I spoke to Sen. Scott last weekend. I plan to call him today. I don’t see this situation as over at all,” Bass insisted. “I have a long list of my Republican colleagues from Judiciary who expressed opposition to all sorts of things in the hearing. I think that leaves a basis from which to talk.” Also optimistic was Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the high-profile freshman Democrat who has urged her own party to embrace more ambitious policy solutions to endemic problems of poverty and inequality. “I think the amount of people in the street and the pressure has created a unique circumstance where I do believe both parties are feeling the heat to pass something,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “I think that people are working with the failures of institutions,” she added. “They’re working around it in order to push through the changes they’re looking for.”",
    "[] President Trump is trailing rival Joe Biden in the presidential elections in Texas, Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina, according to a new Fox News poll. Respondents in Texas backed Biden by a one-point margin over Trump, with 45 percent saying they would vote for the former vice president if elections were held today, compared with 44 percent for Trump. Among respondents who said they were “extremely” motivated to vote, however, Trump won 51 percent to Biden’s 45 percent. In the same poll, Senator John Cornyn (R., Texas) led his Democratic challenger by a ten-point margin among likely voters. Voters in Florida, meanwhile, backed Biden at 49 percent to Trump’s 40 percent. Respondents from that state preferred Biden on handling of the coronavirus pandemic (49–36 percent) and management of immigration (50–40 percent). Biden won among Latino voters, a key Florida constituency, by a margin of 17 points. Biden also beat Trump in polls of Georgia (47–45 percent) and North Carolina (47–45 percent). All four polls were conducted from June 20-23. Voters generally rated Biden higher than Trump on race relations and possible handling of the pandemic, while respondents preferred Trump’s handling of the economy. The general elections and concurrent political campaigns have been upended by the pandemic, with campaigns forced to cancel many in-person events and some states allowing more leeway for mail-in voting. Trump currently trails Biden, 50 percent to 40 percent, in the RealClearPolitics polling averages.

    "[] By David Shepardson and Nandita Bose WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security sent a letter to chief executives of five large tech companies asking them to ensure social media platforms are not used to incite violence in the wake of nationwide protests following George Floyd's death. \"I am writing to ask you to do your part to put an end to violence and illegal activity spreading across our country by ensuring that your platforms are not used as a tool to organize, facilitate, or incite dangerous or deadly riots, in violation of state and local laws,\" Acting Secretary Chad Wolf said in the letter. Wolf said the department supports First Amendment rights that allow citizens to freely express themselves but cautioned against social media being weaponized to perpetuate criminal activity. \"The misuse of social media platforms to coordinate criminal acts threatens the safety and security of our nation,\" Wolf wrote, adding: \"the department supports the powerful voice that social media provides to its users.\" He asked Facebook, Twitter, Alphabet's Google, Snapchat and Apple to help end information sharing on how to break city curfews, which stores or neighborhoods to target for looting or destruction, and for the coordination of attacks against particular people or groups of people. The June 25 letter, first reported by the Washington Post, comes as the administration of President Donald Trump has begun targeting people for vandalizing monuments and statues during protests against racial inequality. Twitter said it would respond to the letter. Snapchat, Apple and Facebook did not comment while Google did not immediately respond. Some firms have taken action after tweets from Trump himself. Snapchat this month stopped promoting Trump's account on its Discover page in early June after his statement threatening protesters with \"vicious dogs and ominous weapons.\" Twitter this week placed a warning notice on a Trump tweet threatening “serious force” against protesters in the U.S. capital, the second time it used the label.

    "[] WASHINGTON – It’s a highly classified dossier outlining the most urgent and credible national security threats of the day. And that top-secret document is suddenly in the spotlight. The president’s daily intelligence brief, or PDB, is now at the center of a firestorm over reports that Russia offered bounties to Taliban militants to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan. The White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said Monday that President Donald Trump was not \"personally briefed\" on intelligence about the alleged Russian operation. But McEnany would not say whether that explosive information was relayed to Trump in his daily written intelligence briefing, which he does not usually read, according to multiple media reports. McEnany on Tuesday disputed assertions that Trump doesn't read his daily intelligence briefings. She also said there are disagreements among U.S. intelligence officials about the credibility of the Russian bounty intelligence, in trying to explain why Trump was not orally told about it. So what is the presidential daily brief? And how does Trump get his intelligence information, if he does not always read the written digest delivered to him every day? According to the CIA, the PDB has been presented to every president since Feb. 15, 1946, when then-President Harry Truman received what was then known as \"the Daily Summary,\" chock full of secret warnings and classified insights about the most urgent threats against the United States. The format is customized to each new president – to match reading preferences and the way information is absorbed. \"Some presidents prefer to have it all told to them, some prefer to read it,\" said Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer and now Democratic congresswoman. \"It's really an issue of how does the consumer – in this case the president – get the information that's necessary.\" Presidents are also assigned a briefer who becomes accustomed to the desired format and can anticipate what questions the commander-in-chief might ask. In the current administration, the written PDB can be anywhere from 18 to 75 pages, depending on what is going on in the world at a particular time, said two administration officials speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. The report is divided into specific issue areas, such as COVID-19 or Afghanistan, and often includes charts, graphs, and bullet points. The written briefing is distributed across the government, and more than 100 people beyond Trump can have access to it, from the Pentagon to the State Department, the officials said. The intelligence community presents conclusions in the written PDB with different degrees of confidence, from low to high, officials said. Only items that carry a high degree of confidence are presented in person to the president, and that did not include reports that Russia may be paying bounties for the deaths of U.S. soldiers. Officials declined to say whether Trump read about that allegation in the PDB, or how closely he reads the documents in general. They did say there are government officials who do not believe there is enough evidence to prove that Russia is actually paying bounties. They did not specify who those officials are or how many there are. Trump’s primary briefer is Beth Sanner, who carries the title of Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Mission Integration. Officials said the president also talks intelligence matters with department heads such as National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. To produce the PDB, intelligence officials work through the night to sift through a constantly churning stream of intelligence information and determine what the president needs to know. \"Then the PDB briefers come in in the very wee hours of the morning to get themselves up to speed on what's in it\" and prepare themselves to present it to the president, said Carol Rollie Flynn, a 30-year CIA veteran. The PDB also usually goes to the president's top national security advisers, such as his secretaries of defense and state. Former President George W. Bush took the printed copy and then had his briefer walk him through it, Flynn said. \"He liked to have his full team there, so it was a real conversation every day,\" said Flynn, who is now with the Foreign Policy Research Institute. In 2014, intelligence officials switched from a printed PDB to an electronic one at the request of then-President Barack Obama, according to a CIA history of the PDB. Robert Cardillo, a former intelligence official and PDB briefer in the Obama administration, said he considered two questions when assembling the president’s daily brief: \"Does the president need to know this? And if the answer's yes, does the president need to know this now?” Cardillo said Obama wanted his PDB delivered by 6 am. He would read it then and have an oral briefing on the material a few hours later. The main PDB is usually less than 20 pages long, according to David Priess, a former CIA officer and presidential briefer who served in the  Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. \"And for 55 years, *every* POTUS (possibly excepting of Nixon) has read it,\" Priess tweeted on Monday amid the escalating controversy of whether Trump knew about the Russian bounty report. The New York Times has reported that intelligence information outlining the Russian bounty operation was included in Trump's PDB in February. The Associated Press reported that Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, told colleagues that he briefed Trump on the intelligence assessment in March 2019. Like his predecessors, Trump also gets regular in-person briefings from members of the intelligence community. This is Trump's preferred method of getting intelligence information, and it happens about two or three times a week, according to daily schedules released by the White House. Trump is often briefed by Sanner, who was appointed deputy director of national intelligence for mission integration in May 2019. Trump rarely seemed to absorb the intelligence information even when he was orally briefed, according to Bolton's new book, \"The Room Where It Happened,\" released last week. “Trump generally had only two intelligence briefings per week, and in most of those, he spoke at greater length than the briefers, often on matters completely unrelated to the subjects at hand,” Bolton writes in the book. Experts say that U.S. intelligence officials should have alerted Trump to the Russia bounty intelligence in whatever form he prefers, given the grave threat to American troops in the field. Cardillo said intelligence officials have what’s called a “duty to warn” if they come upon information that American lives are at risk from a foreign actor. That means, he said, that information goes up the chain “almost immediately” and often without being fully vetted because it’s so important. Frank Kendall, a former undersecretary for Defense, said it would be \"career-ending\" for an intelligence official not to relay that kind of information. “When soldiers’ lives are at stake, there's a very strong burden and a very high priority” to relay that information, Kendall said. “And not providing that sort of information would be at least career-ending for people if it was found out later on that they had it and had not it passed on.” As with warnings about the coronavirus pandemic, it seems to have fallen through the cracks, said John Gans, author of \"White House Warriors: How the National Security Council Transformed the American Way of War.\" \"The hints of threats are being seen, warnings are being sounded, but neither the president nor anyone else are heeding them,\" said John Gans, author of \"White House Warriors: How the National Security Council Transformed the American Way of War.\" Rep. Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the intelligence about potential Russian bounties was likely included in the president's daily brief but not conveyed to Trump in a formal threat briefing because it wasn't yet \"actionable.\" McCaul made the remarks to NBC, and his office confirmed them with USA TODAY. \"I think the way the process works is that he (Trump) gets briefed about three times a week on sort of actionable, credible items,\" McCaul told NBC. \"And the decision was made that this was not at that point in time a credible, actionable piece of intelligence. And if at any point it did, it would be raised to his attention.\" 'Nonsense': Election experts reject Trump's claims of possible counterfeit ballots Intelligence gathering is like 'putting together a tapestry' Flynn said it's no surprise if there were disagreements among U.S. intelligence agencies and analysts about the reliability of the information about Russia's alleged operation. \"What happens a lot when you get this kind of information, it's fragmentary,\" she said. \"You get a little bit from one person, a little bit from another, maybe a little bit from an intercept. And you're kind of putting it together like a tapestry, and usually there's some holes here and there.\" She said it sounds like that is what happened with the Russian bounty intelligence. And because it's so alarming and provocative, she said, \"you want to be really careful that you don't give it more credibility than it deserves.\" She noted that once such information is relayed to the president, it could lead retaliatory action or another major policy decision. But Spanberger and others said any information in the president's daily brief must be deemed urgent and credible. And if that's the case with the Russian bounty information – and intelligence officials knew Trump would not read the PDB – then they should have told the president directly about it. Republican Sen. Todd Young, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was \"alarmed\" that Trump was not briefed on the intelligence information. He suggested intelligence officials should be held \"accountable for their gross negligence\" for failing to alert the president, and he called for congressional hearings to probe the Russia allegations. \"We must work to ascertain the reliability of media reports and, where necessary, advance accountability within our own government and facilitate a punishing response to the seemingly immoral, illegal, and unconscionable actions of the dictator who lords over the Russian people,\" Young, of Indiana, said in a statement Monday. This report in particular should have been flagged for Trump because of the importance of U.S.-Russian relations and the potential threat to American military personnel, said Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican who sits on the Senate intelligence committee. \"What we’re talking about here is putting the target crosshairs on the backs of American servicemen and women in uniform,\" Sasse told reporters Monday. He said Congress should be focused on two questions:  \"No. 1, Who knew what, when, and did the commander-in-chief know? And if not, how the hell not?\" Spanberger said whether Trump was briefed or not, \"we all know now,\" as she put in in a tweet. So the real question, she said, is \"how are we going to act\" on the information? What we know:Russia reportedly offered bounty on US troops in Afghanistan.

    "[] Ever since I was a little boy, the other boys never called me “John” or “Johnny” or even “Roberts.” It was always “John Roberts.” The words would always run together, so in essence my name, to one and all, was “JohnRoberts.” “JohnRoberts, did you hear wrestling practice was canceled?” “JohnRoberts, Father Reilly said he wants to see you after Mass.” “JohnRoberts, do you want to go to the Dairy Queen for a root beer?” (Root was the only kind of beer I drank.) I did consider it a little strange when my own father started calling me “JohnRoberts,” but I didn’t mind. It was simply a gesture of respect for my immense propriety. I wanted to impress my elders with my rectitude, and I think I did. I impressed the other students too. I know I was not seen the way the other boys were. People didn’t ask me, “Hey, JohnRoberts, want to go get high and see Gimme Shelter?” More often they would ask me for my opinion about cross-comparing the various options in life-insurance annuities or what model sedan I considered the most decorous and respectable. (Buick. Always Buick.) Often a group of boys would approach me, and one boy in the group would ask me these kinds of questions while his friends stood around, snickering at some private joke to which I was not privy. In retrospect, I suppose these were strange questions to ask a high schooler, but then again, it was my practice to wear long, black silken robes everywhere I went, just to be prepared for my future. I guess you could say young Kavanaugh did enough youthful hijinks for the both of us. He once told me he went to see Porky’s when he was only 16 and a half! Can you imagine? He’s a card, that boy. Sometimes the fellows would ask me for my philosophy of life, which is intertwined with my legal philosophy, which is what I want to speak to you about today. I know that some of you are calling attention to how, when the liberals have five votes without me, I sometimes let forth a mighty roar denouncing the irreparable harm to our constitutional fabric, but when the liberals have only four votes without me, I tend to join them, while issuing a meek, technicality-filled ruling explaining why I’m unable to do anything conservative because, well, that’s just how the law works. I know that some of you are calling my judicial philosophy “Loserism” behind my back, and that is hurtful to me. Our side is not “losing.” That’s preposterous. I prefer the term “alternative winning.” Let me explain how alternative winning works. This week, though I did stop the liberals from singling out religious schools for punishment in Montana, I know I disappointed conservatives when I voted the wrong way about abortion (again) and even voted against myself, just four years ago on a very similar case. What you don’t give me enough credit for is quoting Edmund Burke in my decision. Burke, I need not remind you, is a conservative icon. You think you would have gotten a Burke reference out of Sotomayor or Kagan? No, that’s what JohnRoberts gave you. I don’t merely let our adversaries whip conservatives about the head and neck with rusty chains, I quote Edmund Burke while I join them in whipping conservatives about the head and neck with rusty chains. Burke should warm your heart as you pass into unconsciousness because your spinal column feels like it’s being stomped on by orcs. Alternative winning. Some of you have pointed out that when I joined the liberals to save Obamacare eight years ago by declaring that the penalty for not complying with the individual mandate was a tax, I not only disagreed with the people who wrote the law but switched sides at the last minute. It wounded me when some of you described this as “chickening out.” I prefer to think of it as “alternative courage.” As I said at the time, “It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices,” even constitutionally dodgy ones. You vote it, you got it! When it comes to American voters enacting any limits on abortion whatsoever, though, it is most definitely my job to save American voters from the policies they vote for. You vote it, you must be stopped! The rules, as Elena Kagan has so helpfully explained to me, are straightforward enough: Abortion is not in the Constitution, but it’s implied by the right to privacy, which is also not in the Constitution, but the implications within these non-specified rights are super-specific. Even down to the level of whether Louisiana medical professionals doing abortions must be held to the same standards as Louisiana medical professionals doing LASIK: This question was settled for all time back in 1787. Though I was on the opposite side of this particular question in 2016, the doctrine known as stare decisis means I am not allowed to agree with 2016 me. Stare decisis, of course, is Latin for “I can’t do anything hard.” True, I voted to overturn longstanding precedents in Citizens United v. FEC (2010), Janus v. AFSCME (2018), and Knick v. Township of Scott (2019), which means “respects the precedent” goes out the window when I’m feeling up to doing my job. You might say that it is our duty as Justices to drop-kick bad precedents, as we have done throughout the whole history of the country. Sometimes I do that! If it’s not too hard. But the Louisiana case is quite hard, because it’s about abortion. You may have noticed that when the liberals don’t get what they want on abortion, they turn . . . grouchy. This matters, because they get to write all of the newspaper stories and history books. It is therefore my considered judgment that if I did anything that made it the least bit difficult for any American to get an abortion, my well-earned reputation for judiciousness would suddenly be worth about as much as a Jefferson Davis statue in Harlem. It is my settled view that no one should ever be mad at JohnRoberts, pillar of rectitudinous propriety. Fellows, I worked really hard to be boring. My passion in school was Latin. Do you think I want there to be a chapter in the history books dedicated to hating JohnRoberts? The U.S. is one of the seven most permissive countries on earth for abortion. That may be unfortunate, but as long as it stays that way, no one’s dragging an effigy of JohnRoberts through the streets.

    "[] Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) has been the object of liberal ire since her 2018 vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Now in a tight re-election fight, whatever hopes she might have had of putting that episode behind her were dashed this week, when now-Justice Kavanaugh cast a dissenting vote in the Supreme Court’s latest decision to uphold the legal framework that grants access to women seeking abortions. But the legacy of Collins’ vote on Kavanaugh hasn’t been all bad for the longtime Maine senator. In fact, it’s appeared to earn her some powerful and deep-pocketed new allies. Collins, who’s staked out a brand as a pro-choice moderate Republican over her nearly 24 years in the Senate, has historically never been a favorite in the conservative legal circles embodied by the Federalist Society, a leading group of right-of-center attorneys and legal thinkers. But that, apparently, has changed dramatically since Collins’ fateful vote. Since 2019, Collins’ campaign and two associated political action committees have raked in nearly $200,000 from donors who are also high-dollar contributors to the Federalist Society. Many of those who gave to Collins had never cut a check for her before. New Kavanaugh Book: Sen. Feinstein Dithered on Ford Letter The group of 39 donors includes Leonard Leo, the former executive vice president of the Federalist Society and a driving force behind President Trump and the Senate GOP’s historically successful efforts to stock the federal bench with conservative judges. Leo and his wife, Sally—neither of whom had previously donated to Collins—each gave the maximum $5,600 to Collins’ campaign committee last year. Half of Leo’s support came by way of a joint fundraising committee supporting three other Senate Republicans. Last summer, Leo hosted a fundraiser for Collins at his newly bought Maine vacation home, an event that appeared to open up more Federalist Society funds for the senator. Leo was one of five Federalist Society-associated first-time donors to Collins, a group that also included Daniel Casey. Casey is the president of the Judicial Crisis Network, a group with ties to the Federalist Society that led the charge for Kavanaugh’s confirmation. GOP mega-donors linked to the group also got on board with Collins after her vote. Philip Anschutz, the billionaire whose foundation supports the Federalist Society, gave $5,600, the per-cycle maximum, to Collins’ campaign. Others were not first-time Collins donors but dramatically stepped up their giving this year. In 2019, Bernard Marcus, co-founder of Home Depot, and his wife Billi Wilma gave a total of $20,800 to Collins’ campaign and to her leadership PAC. The couple’s foundation is part of the Federalist Society’s Madison Club, the honorific bestowed on its major donors. Marcus is in the Club’s Platinum Level, reserved for those who give $100,000 or more. Previously, the couple had donated a total of $3,000 to Collins across her 2014 and 2008 re-election campaigns. Support for Collins from C. Boyden Gray, a former counsel to President George H.W. Bush and a Federalist Society board member, also illustrates the evolving relationship between the senator and the conservative legal group. In 2003, Gray’s conservative advocacy group ran controversial ads in Maine pressuring the senator to vote in favor of a conservative Bush nominee, William Pryor, Jr., to the bench. Ultimately, Collins was one of just two Republican senators to vote against Pryor. After giving $3,600 to her 2014 effort, Gray has given nearly $8,000 to Collins’ political outfit since her Kavanaugh vote. Susan Collins’ Obama-Era Vote Against Pandemic Funding Comes Back to Haunt Her Most of the donations from Federalist Society backers went directly to Collins’ campaign. Some also supported Collins’ leadership PAC, which she can use to dole out funds to allies and help build political capital. Others financed the Collins Victory Committee, a joint fundraising account supporting both her campaign and her leadership PAC. The groundswell in financial support that Collins is receiving from conservative legal bigwigs comes at a time when the nation’s courts have become increasingly politicized. Kavanaugh’s nomination became a rallying point for many Democrats and Democratic-allied groups. And Collins’ support for it—which culminated in a nationally watched Senate floor speech—put a target squarely on her back. While those invested in the confirmation rushed to offer their appreciation, progressives began fundraising for her challenger immediately, raising more than four million dollars before Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon even became the Democratic frontrunner. The end result has been one of the more expensive and tightly fought Senate races of the cycle, with Collins facing a serious challenge for a seat she has held comfortably since 1996. The senator’s campaign has raised over $10.3 million since January 2019; Gideon, meanwhile, has raised over $14.8 million in the same time period. Collins has $1 million more in the bank, however. “Senator Collins has always received strong support from across the ideological spectrum,” Kevin Kelley, a spokesman for Collins’ campaign, told The Daily Beast. “Bribery doesn’t work on Senator Collins,” Kelley added, in reference to the money raised by liberal groups around her Kavanaugh vote. “She made up her mind based on the merits of the nomination. It’s laughable that the same people who tried to buy Senator Collins’ vote for more than $4 million now appear to be suggesting that she sold her vote for far less.” The Federalist Society did not respond to a request for comment. But a source close to the Kavanaugh confirmation process described the donations as an organic show of support for a senator crucial to getting popular conservative judges confirmed. The source said there was no organized effort to back Collins financially after her confirmation vote, but that people active in the conservative legal community independently deemed her worthy of support. \"Countless Americans were inspired by Senator Collins’ principled speech in support of Justice Kavanaugh,” the source said, “so it should not be surprising to anyone that she raised more money after that, especially in light of the disgusting threats that were being made toward her and her staff at the time.” As for the donations that liberals made to a prospective campaign account for Collins’ eventual opponent, those too have been criticized as an attempt to financially incentivize the Senator’s vote; and not just by Collins’ aides. A conservative election attorney, Cleta Mitchell, told Newsmax at the time that the liberal groups may have run afoul of federal law by “trying to tie her official action to their threat that they’re going to give $1 million to somebody to run against her, if she doesn’t vote the way [they want her] to.” Ady Barkan, the progressive activist who launched the campaign, insisted it was legal and had the blessing of the Federal Elections Commission. Mitchell, a financial supporter of the Federalist Society, later gave $1,000 to Collins’ campaign, her first donation, after her vote to confirm Kavanaugh. Read more at The Daily Beast.

    "[] 原标题：美政府“甩锅” 连西方媒体都不“买账” 来源：新华社 美国总统特朗普日前宣布，暂停向世界卫生组织缴纳会费。他指责世界卫生组织没有及时分享疫情信息，没有及时提供防疫政策建议，从而导致全球疫情扩散。不仅世界人民，连西方媒体对这一说辞都不“买账”。 《纽约时报》指出，特朗普企图将其应对疫情不力遭批评的炮火“转嫁”给世卫组织。“近期民调显示，大多数美国人并不赞同特朗普应对疫情的措施。所以本周二，特朗普下令暂停向世卫组织缴纳会费，试图转移矛盾。” 路透社报道称，随着全球因疫情死亡人数攀升，特朗普暂停向世卫组织缴纳会费举动遭到医药卫生专家和国际社会的普遍谴责。 美国国务卿蓬佩奥在一旁敲边鼓，为特朗普的“退群”行为背书。他在15日接受福克斯新闻台采访时指责世卫组织“串通”中国隐瞒疫情，他说：“我们需要答案……我们需要公开透明。” 矛盾的是，早在疫情初期，特朗普就曾多次在公开场合对世卫组织和中国应对疫情的举措进行称赞，并表示一直在保持密切沟通。美国副总统彭斯2月7日接受CNBC电视台采访时也说：“中国在处理新冠肺炎疫情时采取了非常公开透明的做法，不仅是对美国，对国际社会也都保持公开透明。”     （特朗普1月31日帖文译文：正密切和中国及其他国家合作控制疫情。目前美国只有5人感染，一切都在好转、恢复。） （特朗普2月25日帖文译文：新冠肺炎疫情在美国控制的非常好。我们和其他相关国家和国际组织一直在保持交流。美国疾控中心和世卫组织都在努力工作，他们非常聪明。股票市场看起来也非常不错！） 许多世界主流媒体也采用时间轴的形式，梳理了特朗普自新冠肺炎暴发以来的各种花式“打脸”言论。例如英国广播公司的一则报道就展现了特朗普如何从一开始淡化病毒的严重性，高估美国为此做出的准备，到由于自己的无知、应对不力而导致病毒急剧扩散。     从赞赏世卫组织和中国的抗疫举措、淡化疫情的严重性到抨击、污蔑、抹黑二者，极力推卸责任，背后的原因究竟是什么？ 《华盛顿邮报》近日撰文《疫情肆虐 美国陷入推诿和机能失调之困》，文章指出，特朗普政府早在1月3日就接到中国暴发新冠疫情的正式通知。数天内，美国情报机构不断提示特朗普疫情的严重性，其中一条警告就出现在总统每日简讯里。 然而，从特朗普认识到疫情不是遥远的威胁或是尽在掌控之中的流感，而是能击溃美国防御体系、吞噬成千上万美国民众生命的致命力量，花费了整整70天的时间。 根据约翰斯·霍普金斯大学15日发布的新冠肺炎疫情统计数据，全球确诊病例已超过200万例，其中美国感染人数超60万。在疫情最严重的纽约州，共确诊超20万人，死亡超1万人。 早在疫情初期，美国政府不少官员已经认识到问题的严重性。民主党参议员克里斯·墨菲2月5日在推特上发帖说：“刚刚离开政府关于新冠肺炎的记者会。已经到达底线：他们根本没把新冠肺炎当回事。” 墨菲说，美国陷入危机不是因为中国做了什么，也不是因为世卫组织做了什么，而是因为特朗普总统的所作所为。 《华盛顿邮报》指出，事态发展本不应该如此。美国拥有更多的专家、资源、备案和疫情防控经验，结果却比许多国家在病毒面前更不堪一击。就好像“911”的悲剧再次上演了一遍：警告一次次地发出，包括给政府最高层，但是总统充耳不闻，直到病毒长驱直入。 然而，美国政府和媒体的“指责游戏”依旧在上演。近日，又有媒体挂出耸人听闻标题，“中国是不是隐瞒了实际的新冠死亡人数？中国的手机号减少了2100万”，更是无稽之谈。 美联社的一则辟谣报道指出，中国手机用户减少不是和疫情死亡人数相关，而是和疫情本身相关。 面临疫情全球蔓延的严峻形势，尚在恢复元气的中国就向世界无私分享抗疫经验、提供大批援助物资。当喷涂有新英格兰爱国者队队徽的集装箱卡车开进纽约，《纽约邮报》贡献出头版：“有些话我们以为永远不会说--谢谢你，爱国者队。” 货车上满载30万个N95口罩，来自中国。 图为4月4日《纽约邮报》头版。 相互指责、扭曲抹黑不能解决目前全球的疫情困境，唯有相互扶持、团结合作、播撒善意才能一起战胜病毒。 “掌”握科技鲜闻 （微信搜索techsina或扫描左侧二维码关注） 新浪科技 新浪科技为你带来最新鲜的科技资讯 苹果汇 苹果汇为你带来最新鲜的苹果产品新闻 新浪众测 新酷产品第一时间免费试玩 新浪探索 提供最新的科学家新闻，精彩的震撼图片 新浪科技意见反馈留言板 电话：400-052-0066 欢迎批评指正 新浪简介|广告服务|About Sina\n联系我们|招聘信息|通行证注册\n产品答疑|网站律师|SINA English Copyright © 1996-2020 SINA Corporation All Rights Reserved 新浪公司 版权所有",
    "[] 原标题：认真聊聊：饮用或注射消毒液，我们的身体究竟会发生什么？ 当地时间23日，一个“一分钟杀死新冠病毒”的颠覆性见解在华盛顿出炉： 消毒剂在一分钟内就能把病毒消灭，就一分钟，我们有办法也这样做吗？通过注射消毒剂到体内来清洗病毒，因为当消毒剂进入肺部，将会有很大作用，这方法值得检验检验，但也得问问医师，不过这也很有趣…… 据新华社报道，美国总统特朗普23日在白宫举行的新冠疫情通报会上发表的这番“注射消毒剂杀死病毒”的言论，引发舆论热议。 ▲当地时间23日，特朗普在当日的发布会上称，可以考虑将消毒剂注射进身体达到清洗病毒的目的。截图自《央视新闻》 尽管特朗普第二天就“澄清”说，这只是一个“讽刺”行为，是“针对一直提出恶毒问题的记者的回击”，但毫无疑问，还真有人当回事了！  ▲“消毒剂洗肺论”让在场的白宫新冠病毒响应协调员黛博拉·伯克斯博士一脸“不敢置信”。图据NBC新闻 据央视网综合报道，这番言论出现18小时内，纽约市毒物控制局接到了30通相关电话，较去年同期多了一倍；同一时间，100多人拨打马里兰州紧急热线，询问注射或摄入消毒剂是否有助于治愈新冠病毒感染。 而据中国日报报道，当地时间25日，美国伊利诺伊州公共卫生部门负责人埃奇克在发布会上表示，过去两天，该州有毒物质控制中心接到关于误服消毒剂的咨询电话大幅上升，例如，有人用洗涤剂溶液冲洗鼻腔，还有人混合漂白剂和漱口水来漱口……发布会上，埃奇克一脸愁苦：“注射、摄入和吸食家用消毒剂是危险的，这样做可能致命！”  ▲当地时间4月25日，伊利诺伊州公共卫生部门负责人埃奇克举行发布会。图据WICS 尽管觉得被盲目“种草”的一定是极个别极少数，但是借此机会我们不如扯开了谈谈：饮用或者注射消毒剂，我们的身体究竟会发生啥？  饮用滴露&威露士：消化道一路被腐蚀 首先说说此次应激反应最大的利洁时。特朗普话音刚落，滴露制造商利洁时集团就火速发表了份声明，并以加粗的方式勾出重点：“在任何情况下，我们的消毒剂产品都不应该(通过注射、吞入或任何其他途径)进入人体。”  它家的滴露，跟国货之光“威露士”一样，真正起到消毒作用的成分，正儿八经的学名叫做“对氯间二甲苯酚”（PCMX），属于苯酚类消毒液。在美国环保署的杀虫剂数据库中，对PCMX的毒性做了明确说明：一般具有中等到低毒性，但会引起严重的眼部刺激。 而这还只是环境消杀，那么喝……了呢？鉴于PCMX的腐蚀性，它会造成显而易见的食管和肠胃黏膜细胞坏死，临床表现就是食道灼伤，此外还有中毒性肠炎、急性呼吸衰竭、急性肾功能衰竭等等附加伤害，换句话说，喝了约等于自杀。  而且您别说，这还真有临床依据。据中新社报道，香港中毒咨询中心此前通过数年的样本积累，整理回顾了历年喝滴露自杀、且在48小时内获救的患者档案，然后明确指出，此类患者最常见症状包括气管、消化道腐蚀，并特别给出建议：若病人昏迷，建议医护毋需犹豫，直接为其插喉，否则气管肿胀恐有窒息之虞，而一旦已发生肿胀，插喉都是一项很难实施的操作了。  注射乙醇&异丙醇：注射时血管就会被暴力“撕裂” 当然，特朗普拿来“打趣”记者的可能并不是PCMX。 根据CNN报道，在23日的吹风会上，特朗普总统是在听取国土安全部科技事务副部长威廉·布莱恩的演讲后发表注射消毒剂言论的。 当时，布莱恩在演讲中对一项研究结果进行了介绍。该研究表明，太阳能、消毒剂和异丙醇可在消灭新冠病毒时发挥强大作用，而布莱恩的原话是，“……消毒剂可以在5分钟内杀死病毒。异丙醇能在30秒内杀死病毒。你只需擦一下，病毒会消失得更快。”  ▲威廉·布莱恩在演讲中的确提及异丙醇对病毒有强大作用，但并没有说是内用。图据《纽约时报》 布莱恩说的其实没错，异丙醇跟它的家族兄弟乙醇一样，都可以凝固蛋白质，导致微生物死亡，只不过它自带两个甲基，亲脂性大大增强，因此外用消杀时，表现也更优秀。但是……注射进身体呢？ 首先，因为其凝固蛋白质的能力，注射会对血管内壁造成严重损伤——细胞破裂、内出血，这种刺激会让人剧痛难忍，使得注射根本难以实现。 推到更极端的情况来说，继续强行注射并且还成功了，那么不需要太多，几十毫升，人体直接醇类中毒——昏迷、脑出血、永久性的视觉减退或失明。再多一点点，就有可能导致呼吸麻痹进而致人死亡。 因为相较于饮用，直接将它们注射进入血液引起的反应更为激烈。事实上，关于误用酒精注射的医疗事故在全球都时有发生，而由于其巨大的杀伤力，甚至还出现过故意注射酒精的谋杀案件。  注射“84”类漂白剂：逃不过的血栓和肾脏损伤 同款惨绝人寰的疼痛，也会在注射漂白剂时发生——类似“84”这样的含氯消毒液。 据美国第四大媒体《Slate》的一份科普，一项极小规模的研究表明，若静脉注射漂白剂，注射部位及心脏部位会产生强烈的烧灼感和难以忍受的疼痛。  而更要命的是它对身体的深度侵害。漂白液会使血管内壁严重发炎，进而形成血栓；成分中的氯离子会改变血液的PH值，进而导致心律失常。而尽职尽责过滤血液的肾脏，因为全面接触此类“毒物”，又会遭受严重的功能损伤。此外，由于接触其成分的红细胞破裂，其携氧功能被破坏，重要器官因此供氧不足，又会加剧机体的慢性死亡。 事实上，关于注射消毒剂的确切效果，的确找不到多少文献记载，因为进行这样的实验本身就极不符合实验室伦理。哪怕是上述这个“极小规模研究”，实际上也是来源于美国急诊室的长期积累——在某些“都市传说”中，注射漂白剂可以“清除”吸毒者血液中的杂质，或者“中和”使用过量的阿片类药物……但现实中，这些因“迷信”被送进急诊室的瘾君子们，却不得不承受代价高昂的“疼痛”——严重的、不可逆转的器官损伤。  正因为如此，全球卫生政策专家古普塔博士（Vin Gupta）直接在NBC连线中开怼：“将任何类型的清洁产品注入或摄入体内的想法都是不负责任的，而且很危险。除非有人想自杀，才会这么干。”  “消毒剂洗肺论”余波未平，白宫首次取消例行发布会 眼下，为了“辟谣”，磨破了嘴皮子的科学家们两只手都数不过来。 美国加利福尼亚大学伯克利分校公共政策学教授罗伯特·赖克怒而发推：“这场吹风会置公共健康于危险之中。请不要饮用消毒剂。”澳大利亚首席医疗官布兰登·墨菲也语重心长：“不要注射消毒剂，那对人体有毒。” 英国东英吉利大学药物学教授保罗·亨特隔空发飙：“这完全是一个危险又疯狂的建议……真这么干了，你可能不会死于新冠病毒感染，因为你可能早已死于注射（消毒剂）。”  这些“误解”显然让特朗普“很受伤”。据《环球时报》报道，在“消毒剂洗肺论”发表第二天（24日）的白宫疫情发布会上，特朗普没有接受记者提问，而是在通报当天疫情进展后便径直离开发布会大厅。以往经常持续一个小时之久的发布会，这次也只开了22分钟就草草结束。《纽约时报》也注意到，当地时间25日，白宫数个星期以来首次没有举行每日例行的新冠疫情新闻发布会。 而眼下，特朗普又发推称：“如果歪曲事实的媒体只会问一些满怀敌意的问题，而且还不准确客观地报道，那么搞这个白宫发布会还有什么意义。他们赚取了破纪录的收视率，而美国人民除了假新闻以外一无所获。不值得花这时间和力气！”  但这并没有阻止舆论继续发酵。据新华社报道，美国乔治敦大学全球卫生法教授劳伦斯·戈斯廷警告称，忽视科学会使人丧命。他说，现在处于历史性流行病的蔓延中，要以科学作引导，“可遗憾的是，美国公共卫生专家越发被晾在一边”。 还有医生抱怨此次风波影响了正常的抗疫工作。纽约市一家医院的急诊医生克雷格·斯潘塞在社交媒体上说，医生们现在不得不开始解释为什么人们不应喝消毒剂或异丙醇，“这些时间原本可以用来讨论在未来如何更好应对疫情”。 来源：红星新闻综合自环球时报、中新社、参考消息、央视新闻、CNN、Slate “掌”握科技鲜闻 （微信搜索techsina或扫描左侧二维码关注） 新浪科技 新浪科技为你带来最新鲜的科技资讯 苹果汇 苹果汇为你带来最新鲜的苹果产品新闻 新浪众测 新酷产品第一时间免费试玩 新浪探索 提供最新的科学家新闻，精彩的震撼图片 新浪科技意见反馈留言板 电话：400-052-0066 欢迎批评指正 新浪简介|广告服务|About Sina\n联系我们|招聘信息|通行证注册\n产品答疑|网站律师|SINA English Copyright © 1996-2020 SINA Corporation All Rights Reserved 新浪公司 版权所有",
    "[]  安装新浪财经客户端第一时间接收最全面的市场资讯→【下载地址】 原标题：75万吨土豆可能被扔掉！鲜花销毁、草莓喂牛……困境下，全球食品生产水平如何？ 来源：央视新闻客户端 原标题： 受新冠肺炎疫情影响，美国多家大型肉类加工企业被迫关闭，全美食品供应链正面临中断。为缓解食品行业危机，特朗普政府宣布了总规模为190亿美元的援助计划。而美国以外的多个国家，也正在面临同样的危机。 疫情使得原本就已经因贸易摩擦而承压的美国食品行业进一步雪上加霜。 当地行业机构提供的数据显示，在华盛顿州一个州，过剩的土豆量就有约10亿磅，也就是45万吨。在佛罗里达州，大量已经成熟的玉米只能烂在地里，或是被扔掉。据美国市场营销协会估算，总计约有价值50亿美元的新鲜水果和蔬菜被浪费，全球最大的乳制品公司美国奶农估算，每天倒掉的牛奶多达370万加仑，接近98万升。泰森食品公司董事长警告，未来数周，美国可能有数百万鸡、牛、猪被淘汰。 为了救助食品行业，特朗普政府已经宣布总规模约为190亿美元的救助计划，其中，160亿美元用以支付农民和牧场主，30亿美元用来直接购买新鲜农产品、乳制品和肉类。但这仍然难以弥补农民的损失，而全球其他国家政府也面临类似的压力。 在欧洲，比利时人被要求每周至少吃2次薯条，因为超过75万吨的土豆有被扔掉的危险。 因为大量活动取消，鲜花需求量锐减，占全球鲜花市场约80%市场份额的荷兰也只得将鲜花堆肥，也就是做成肥料。据全球最大的鲜花生产商和拍卖商——荷兰皇家优荷花品称，上周的花卉和植物拍卖价格比一年前低22%。在印度，大量盛放的鲜花也面临同样的命运，因为庆典、婚礼和宗教活动基本都被取消，花农们不得不销毁鲜花，在这里，新鲜的草莓也没有了销路，只得拿来喂牛。 虽然面临各种困境，但目前全球食品生产水平仍然是健康的。而在困境之中，农民们也在自主寻求改变。比如，一些销售蘑菇的商户已经开始从以前主要卖给餐馆和学校的批发式供应，转为面向个人消费者的零售。 美国嘉吉集团全球董事长 麦伟德：我认为食品系统正在承压，在一线工作的工人们很有韧性，他们正在用创新的方式保持国家食品供应。我想在零售业可能会看到不同产品的短缺，但我认为食品服务行业很具韧性，而且我们也看到了一些在食品服务需求方面的回升。 （编辑 隋博宇） 责任编辑：张国帅 24小时滚动播报最新的财经资讯和视频，更多粉丝福利扫描二维码关注（sinafinance） 新浪财经意见反馈留言板 电话：400-052-0066 欢迎批评指正 新浪简介|广告服务|About Sina\n联系我们|招聘信息|通行证注册\n产品答疑|网站律师|SINA English Copyright © 1996-2020 SINA Corporation All Rights Reserved 新浪公司 版权所有",
    "[] 原标题：热评国际丨美国疫情：一边是复工复产 一边是病毒检测不足不公 来源：央视网 目前，美国新冠肺炎疫情依然严峻，但在白宫推进下，“重启”经济、各州复工复产已箭在弦上。卫生专家曾表示，如果要安全复工，必须要将美国的新冠病毒检测量进一步提升，然而近期白宫的一系列行为却充分说明了美国新冠病毒检测的不足和不公平。 美国总统特朗普在5月5日前往亚利桑那州参观霍尼韦尔国际公司的口罩生产工厂时全程佩戴了护目镜，却始终未戴口罩。在抵达亚利桑那州时，特朗普也没有遵守安全社交距离准则，还和人亲昵地拍了肩膀。除了总统，一些随行人员也没有佩戴口罩。 5月6日，特朗普在白宫椭圆形办公室回答记者就此问题的提问时辩解称，他在其他时候佩戴了口罩，而且他“离其他人很远，和制造口罩的工人很远”。 原来提前测试过了 然而，随后美国媒体就曝出特朗普决定不戴口罩的真正原因：他的随行团队和所参观工厂内的员工都提前进行了病毒检测。 其实，在出发前往亚利桑那州之前，特朗普就跟记者说，所有同行的人都已测试，还顺便自夸了一下“咱的快速筛检5分钟就能出结果”。 提前对相关人员作好检测足以说明，白宫非常清楚——如果要保证健康，让同一空间的其他人不会有面临接触新冠病毒的风险，就要对人们进行充分的病毒检测。 其他人？不用这么多测试 然而，就在承认自己及随行人员都进行了检测的同一天，特朗普却对检测的重要性发表了“质疑”。他说，美国现在的新冠病毒测试量非常大，但“没必要”。 最近刚上任的白宫新闻秘书凯莉·麦克纳尼也在6日的记者会上附和了总统的观点。当记者问她是否应该将同样的检测标准应用到所有民众身上时，麦克纳尼说，没有这个必要。 美国全国广播公司的记者这样评价白宫的言行：总统能放心不戴口罩，是因为工厂内会与他接触的人都进行了检测，且结果均呈阴性；“总统能让人检测，因为他是总统”。那为什么其他已经返工或面临返工的美国人，却“没必要”都进行检测？难道这些人就不需要在工作环境中、与人接触时更加放心吗？ 白宫这位承诺过“永远不会说谎”的新闻秘书说，“咱们现在就别说什么测试‘神话’了，就算现在测试了所有的美国人，一小时后、两小时后我们又要重新测试，因为理论上，你随时都可能感染病毒。所以，所有人都应该测试的想法是没有意义的。” 也就是说，检测对某一部分人很重要，对普通的大众却没什么意义？这不得不让人联想到在美国疫情初期，NBA球员可以在没有任何症状的情况下进行检测，但是很多已经出现症状的普通人还在排队等候。3月18日，有记者问特朗普为什么有人无法检测，没有症状的职业运动员却能得到检测？ 特朗普的回答是：“也许这就是人生。” 检测不是用来吹牛的 美国传染病学家福奇在近期接受《国家地理》杂志采访时就表示，不管是复工还是面对可能在今年秋冬再度暴发的疫情，人们都需要足够的测试来保证正常生活不受病毒侵扰。 福奇说：要确保有足够的测试能力，以及保障实施测试的系统运转；要让需要测试和应该测试的人真正得到测试。到了9月， “如果测试仍然不够，那真是太丢脸了”。 目前，美国仍然是全球唯一确诊感染新冠肺炎病例超过100万例的国家。一方面美国仍然缺乏足够的检测保障安全复工，另一方面又在区别对待不同的检测对象。在疫情仍然严峻的情况下，采用科学态度平等对待所有被检测者、努力提高检测量，才是当前美国防疫最需要的。 “掌”握科技鲜闻 （微信搜索techsina或扫描左侧二维码关注） 新浪科技 新浪科技为你带来最新鲜的科技资讯 苹果汇 苹果汇为你带来最新鲜的苹果产品新闻 新浪众测 新酷产品第一时间免费试玩 新浪探索 提供最新的科学家新闻，精彩的震撼图片 新浪科技意见反馈留言板 电话：400-052-0066 欢迎批评指正 新浪简介|广告服务|About Sina\n联系我们|招聘信息|通行证注册\n产品答疑|网站律师|SINA English Copyright © 1996-2020 SINA Corporation All Rights Reserved 新浪公司 版权所有",

    "[] 原标题：本周，特朗普收到了三个坏消息 据北京头条消息，根据美国约翰斯·霍普金斯大学的数据，截至美国东部时间5月9日晚10时，美国已有逾130.9万人感染新冠肺炎，死亡78792人。 与此同时，新冠病毒版的《白宫沦陷》（2013年好莱坞电影，又名《奥林匹斯的陷落》）正在上演。 本周，特朗普收到的第一个坏消息就是多位“身边人”确诊。 5月6日，美国CNN报道，特朗普的一名随从确诊感染新冠病毒。 这名感染者来自美国海军一支为白宫服务的精锐部队。根据美国媒体报道，总统贴身随从会帮助总统以及第一家庭处理各种私人事务，他们在白宫内负责总统的饮食，还会在总统出行或者是出国的时候随行。 5月8日，特朗普证实，副总统彭斯的新闻秘书凯蒂·米勒新冠病毒检测结果呈阳性，米勒经常与白宫新冠疫情应对工作组沟通，并和媒体记者接触。虽然特朗普称他最近没有与米勒接触，但是米勒的丈夫就是特朗普的高级助手。 同日，特朗普女儿伊万卡的私人助理新冠病毒检测呈阳性。不过这位助理一直远程办公，最近几周没有与伊万卡有接触。 此外，美国国土安全部（DHS）的文件显示，截至5月6日晚上，美国特勤局有11人新冠病毒检测呈阳性。 在这种情况下，白宫调整了防疫举措。 5月7日，白宫已经紧急为上百名工作人员安排了病毒检测，这些工作人员包括了任何可能靠近总统或副总统的特勤局特工和军人。不仅如此，总统、副总统以及任何和总统有直接接触的白宫工作人员，他们的病毒检测频率也从每周改成了每天。 紧接着，特朗普就收到了他本周的第二个坏消息。 当地时间5月9日，因为与确诊患者有过接触，美国过敏与传染病研究所所长福奇、疾病控制与预防中心（CDC）主任雷德菲尔德、食品与药品监督管理局（FDA）局长哈恩都宣布自我隔离14天。 从左至右依次为，福奇、雷德菲尔德、哈恩 三个人都没有透露他们到底和哪位确诊患者有过接触，福奇和雷德菲尔德只表示是接触了白宫的确诊患者。 值得注意的是，福奇、雷德菲尔德和哈恩都是美国应对疫情的核心官员，他们是白宫应对新冠疫情工作组的成员，被称为美国抗疫“三巨头”。而8日宣布确诊的彭斯新闻秘书凯蒂·米勒此前就曾多次参加白宫疫情应对小组的会议。 白宫应对新冠疫情工作组成立于1月29日，负责协调、监督美国政府的防疫工作。工作组由美国副总统彭斯领导，美国全球卫生政策特别代表伯克斯任协调员，成员包括内阁部长、卫生及应急部门负责人等。 就在5月5日，特朗普还说要解散白宫新冠疫情应对工作组，但不到24小时，他就发推特表示，工作组会无限期工作，新重心会放在安全和重启经济上。 现在，工作组确实没有解散，但是已被病毒“包围”。 《华盛顿邮报》指出，紧张和担忧已经越来越在白宫蔓延。报道还披露，当地时间8日，所有白宫工作人员都收到了一份来自白宫管理办公室的备忘录，鼓励他们“最大限度以及尽可能地远程工作”，如果离开华盛顿地区，必须自我隔离14天，并且必须报告所有行程。 但是，这份备忘录依然没有建议白宫的工作人员佩戴口罩。不止是工作人员，特朗普也从未被见过在公共场合戴口罩。 为什么？ 美联社援引美国政府一名消息人士和两名竞选团队官的表述称，特朗普认为佩戴口罩会“传递一个错误的信息”，即他更关注健康，而不是重启经济，且“重启经济”是他在11月美国总统大选获胜的关键。 其中一名官员还说，特朗普担心自己戴着口罩会看起来很可笑，而且这种照片可能会被用于攻击他的广告。 不过目前来看，攻击特朗普暂时还不需要用做广告这么“烧钱”的方式。 美国雅虎新闻报道，在当地时间8日晚的私人电话会议上，对于特朗普政府处理新冠疫情的表现，美国前总统奥巴马直言，这是“一场绝对混乱的灾难”。 CNN还对此评论称，这是奥巴马迄今为止对特朗普政府“最严厉的批评”。 这就是特朗普本周收到的第三个坏消息，内容直指对他甚为重要的总统大选。 奥巴马告诉这场私人电话会议的与会者，此次疫情暴发是在提醒人们，在全球危机期间为什么需要一个强有力的政府。他重申民主党人必须团结一致、支持前总统拜登竞选，呼吁自己的工作人员更多地参与、支持拜登的竞选活动，要在11月大选中一举击败共和党和特朗普。 当然，特朗普的团队也做出了反击。 针对奥巴马的批评，白宫新闻秘书麦克尼9日在一份给CNN的声明中说：“特朗普总统对新冠疫情的应对是前所未有的，这拯救了美国人的生命。” 嗯，还真是“前所未有”。 在2013年电影《白宫沦陷》中，是一伙恐怖分子占领了总统府并劫持美国总统，妄图控制世界。现在，是新冠病毒在美国白宫核心政治圈扩散。 美联社认为，这提醒了美国人民，即使是整个国家最安全的一栋楼也不会对病毒免疫。 《白宫沦陷》剧照 资料 | 央视新闻、环球时报等 编辑 贾聪聪 来源：北京头条 “掌”握科技鲜闻 （微信搜索techsina或扫描左侧二维码关注） 新浪科技 新浪科技为你带来最新鲜的科技资讯 苹果汇 苹果汇为你带来最新鲜的苹果产品新闻 新浪众测 新酷产品第一时间免费试玩 新浪探索 提供最新的科学家新闻，精彩的震撼图片 新浪科技意见反馈留言板 电话：400-052-0066 欢迎批评指正 新浪简介|广告服务|About Sina\n联系我们|招聘信息|通行证注册\n产品答疑|网站律师|SINA English Copyright © 1996-2020 SINA Corporation All Rights Reserved 新浪公司 版权所有",
    "[] 原标题：美国白宫官员证实 彭斯将与特朗普“保持距离” 来源：中新网 据美国中文网报道，美国白宫官员当地时间5月12日证实，美国副总统彭斯将在近期与总统特朗普和整个白宫西翼保持距离。 据报道，彭斯目前没有进行自我隔离。他每天都要进行病毒测试，但他将继续在白宫旁边的艾森豪威尔行政办公大楼工作，他和他的员工在那里设有办公室。     特朗普当地时间12日称，他要求全体白宫工作人员戴上口罩工作。但当天特朗普自己却没有戴口罩，他声称自己不需要遵循这一指示，因为他“远离所有人”。   白宫官员12日证实，根据与白宫医疗部门的协商，彭斯与特朗普将在近期保持距离。彭斯11日缺席了特朗普的新闻发布会。 特朗普称，自从彭斯的新闻秘书确诊以来，两人就再也没有会面，但他们可以通过电话商讨有关内容。他表示，“彭斯测试为阴性，我们必须了解这一点，但他与很多人接触”。 11日与州长们的电话中，彭斯提到他正在采取额外的预防措施，以保持与他人的距离。 另一方面，白宫11日对西翼工作人员实施了一项新规定，要求他们在公共场所始终需要戴口罩。 特朗普相信白宫“非常好”地控制了内部的疫情，称尽管有这么多人在近距离工作，但只有两个人的新冠检测呈阳性。“进入总统办公室的每个人都经过检测，我丝毫不感到易受到感染”，他说。 据此前报道，近日包括美国总统特朗普贴身随从、副总统彭斯新闻秘书和伊万卡•特朗普私人助理相继确诊感染新冠肺炎，与之有过接触的三位美卫生高官、白宫新冠肺炎特别工作组成员均表示将进行“自我隔离”。 “掌”握科技鲜闻 （微信搜索techsina或扫描左侧二维码关注） 新浪科技 新浪科技为你带来最新鲜的科技资讯 苹果汇 苹果汇为你带来最新鲜的苹果产品新闻 新浪众测 新酷产品第一时间免费试玩 新浪探索 提供最新的科学家新闻，精彩的震撼图片 新浪科技意见反馈留言板 电话：400-052-0066 欢迎批评指正 新浪简介|广告服务|About Sina\n联系我们|招聘信息|通行证注册\n产品答疑|网站律师|SINA English Copyright © 1996-2020 SINA Corporation All Rights Reserved 新浪公司 版权所有",
    "[] 原标题：北美观察丨利益驱动无所不为 特朗普被曝企图操控新冠死亡统计 来源：央视新闻客户端 新型冠状病毒疫情在美国大面积暴发，当下形势依然严峻。当地时间5月13日，《每日野兽》（Daily Beast）爆料称，特朗普竟然通过白宫的行政手段施压美国疾控中心（CDC）修改新冠病毒感染致死人数的统计方法，从而让美国新冠疫情的统计数据不那么难看。该报道一出，受到包括《商业内幕》（Business Insider）和《国会山报》（the Hill）等多家美国媒体争相报道，社会反应强烈。 白宫施压：改变统计方法 根据《每日野兽》的报道，白宫正在给美国疾控中心CDC施压，令其从先前统计的新冠疫情死亡病例中剔除两类人。白宫新冠疫情应对小组协调员黛博拉·伯克斯博士称，这两类人分别是在还未确诊前就已经死亡的疑似病例，以及并非直接因为新冠病毒而死亡的病例。据多名不愿透露姓名的白宫工作人员表示，如果统计方法被如此修改，将导致美国因疫情死亡的人数大幅下降。 △特朗普和白宫新冠疫情应对小组协调员黛博拉·伯克斯博士出席4月21日的新冠疫情通报会（图片来源《商业内幕》杂志） 专家反对：这是在扭曲数据 然而，CDC负责统计工作的负责人鲍勃·安德森在接受采访时表示强烈反对，他认为白宫方面提出的修改方法是严重错误的，并且会扭曲真实的疫情状况的。他表示CDC的统计数据真实可靠，甚至目前的死亡数据已经是被低估了的。在美国具有极高声望的防疫专家安东尼·福奇博士也曾在5月12日参议院卫生委员会的听证会上表示，由于各地存在统计遗漏的情况，死于新冠病毒的真实人数肯定高于政府公布的数据。他表示：“有很多被感染的人在没有去医院治疗之前就死在了家里，这些人显然没有被计算到新冠病毒的死亡病例中。” 此番白宫对CDC的施压只是双方近期紧张关系的冰山一角。据称，特朗普政府早先否定了一份CDC针对经济重启制订的“防疫指导”，认为其中的措施“过于严苛”，会妨碍特朗普期望的“经济强势反弹”。根据《沙龙》杂志（Salon）在5月13日的报道，CDC的“防疫指导”和白宫的经济重启计划之间矛盾重重，例如，“防疫指导”敦促公众在重启经济后避免不必要的旅行，而白宫计划在重启的第二阶段即可“随意出行”。 CDC主任罗伯特·雷德菲尔德在参议院听证会上也表示“目前美国还没有走出疫情的困境，需要重建美国的公共卫生体系，仍要保持警惕并且保证社交距离。”显然，特朗普更愿意相信CDC正在夸大疫情导致的死亡病例数据，并且为了满足自己的政治利益，并不在乎统计数据的真实性。 △《沙龙》杂志报道：特朗普向CDC施加压力，改变新冠病毒死亡的统计方式以降低死亡总数 特朗普：“数字是可以调整的” 据消息人士称，特朗普曾在私下里表示，“（自然灾害和战争中的）死亡人数总是被刻意上调或者下调，这次美国疫情中的统计数据也可以存在类似的波动。”显然，特朗普此番迫使CDC改变统计方法，减少病死人数的目的是为了降低疫情在美国普通民众心中的严重程度，为其重启美国经济的计划铺路。然而，这种罔顾事实，操控统计数据的做法注定是在自欺欺人，就像福奇博士在本周的表态那样：过早解除目前的隔离措施将会给美国普通民众带来“不必要的痛苦和死亡”。 “掌”握科技鲜闻 （微信搜索techsina或扫描左侧二维码关注） 新浪科技 新浪科技为你带来最新鲜的科技资讯 苹果汇 苹果汇为你带来最新鲜的苹果产品新闻 新浪众测 新酷产品第一时间免费试玩 新浪探索 提供最新的科学家新闻，精彩的震撼图片 新浪科技意见反馈留言板 电话：400-052-0066 欢迎批评指正 新浪简介|广告服务|About Sina\n联系我们|招聘信息|通行证注册\n产品答疑|网站律师|SINA English Copyright © 1996-2020 SINA Corporation All Rights Reserved 新浪公司 版权所有",
    "[] 原标题：特朗普亲身“试药”，美国专家急坏了：别跟着吃 中新网5月19日电 (卞磊)综合报道，当地时间18日，美国总统特朗普再次语惊四座。他在与酒店餐饮企业负责人开会时，突然自曝正在服用抗疟疾药羟氯喹，目的是“预防感染新冠病毒”。 总统的这番表态，立刻招来各方专业人士紧急“辟谣”。话能乱说，药可不能乱吃！小小一粒药，到底有何能耐，引起这么大的风波？     【“我碰巧在吃。”】 当天，特朗普介绍称，自己服用抗疟疾药物羟氯喹，已约有一周半时间，他称：“我开始服用，是因为我觉得它很好。” 为避免引发猜测，他补充称，自己没有任何感染新冠病毒的症状，并每隔几天接受一次病毒检测，结果都呈阴性。 没有染病，为啥吃药？特朗普自己大概总结出了3点内容。 首先，是“为预防染病”。往前推算一周半，特朗普才刚刚开始服用药物。而当时，白宫已经因为新冠病毒而“沦陷”。 特朗普一名贴身随从、副总统新闻秘书、特朗普女儿的私人助理等白宫工作人员，接连确诊。截至5月8日，十几名负责白宫官员安保工作的特工被感染。在这样的背景下，特朗普开始预防感染新冠病毒。 其次，在特朗普口中，似乎大家都吃药。他在发布会上指出，“美国很多一线的工作人员以及医生、护士都在服用羟氯喹”。 且最“重要”的是，虽然他本人“并不确定这种药物是否会有效”，但他认为，即使该药物无效，也不会让人“生病或者死亡”。   资料图：当地时间5月11日，美国白宫举行了关于新冠肺炎的新闻发布会，白宫新闻秘书和其他白宫工作人员、记者以及美国军方成员均佩戴口罩出现在白宫玫瑰花园参加发布会。   【抗疫“万灵丹”？】 那么，这种总统口中“很好”的药物，究竟是不是“灵丹妙药”？ 早在上世纪三四十年代，氯喹就已得到应用，主要用于治疗疟疾。而特朗普所服用的羟氯喹，是1944年科学家在氯喹的基础上研究而成。两者的治疗作用相近，但后者的毒副作用显著减少，不过仍会对心脏造成损伤。 在新冠疫情暴发后，多国专家推荐采用羟氯喹和阿奇霉素组合药方，用于临床治疗。美国，也不例外。 于是就有了3月19日，特朗普“兜售”羟氯喹的一幕。他宣称，食品药品监督管理局(FDA)已批准使用该药治疗新冠患者。4月4日，特朗普更指出：“如果它奏效，将是一份天赐的礼物”，尽管自己并未染病，但“我可能会使用它，我会询问一下医生。” 这一天，为特朗普“以身试药”正式埋下了伏笔。 然而，与此同时，羟氯喹的疗效正遭到质疑： 美国食品药品监督管理局长对该药药效持谨慎态度； 流行病学专家福奇曾明确表示，羟氯喹能有效治疗新冠患者“仅是传言”； “顶级疫苗专家”生物医学高级研究与开发局局长布赖特，甚至因拒绝将药物推荐给大众，而被解职…… 特朗普亲试的药物，为何引发如此争议？据美国《新英格兰医学杂志》5月7日发表的研究显示，没有证据表明，羟氯喹有助于治疗新冠住院患者。也就是说，该药的药效存疑。 羟氯喹的副作用也不容小觑。据国际学术期刊《自然-医学》文章称，研究者通过对84名接受治疗的患者进行评估发现，使用羟氯喹和阿奇霉素治疗的患者，出现了心电图异常。 《华盛顿邮报》也称，美国退伍军人事务部4月21日发表的一项研究发现，服用羟氯喹药物的新冠患者比未服用该药的患者，更有可能死亡。 显然，特朗普对这些隐患并不买账。在18日的发布会上，他称，自己所知的“唯一负面”报道，与退伍军人医院的患者有关，而他们“并非我的铁杆粉丝”。 【“鲁莽、鲁莽、鲁莽。”】 特朗普自曝服药后，引发高度关注。 “他是我们的总统。我希望他不要服用未经科学家批准的药物”，美国众议院议长、民主党人佩洛西表示，尤其是考虑到他73岁的高龄，以及“病态肥胖”的身体状况。 参议院民主党领袖舒默则直指，特朗普的言论是“危险的”。 “也许他没有真的服药，因为总统会在一些典型的事情上撒谎。”舒默在接受采访时，又补充称：“我不知道他是否在服药。我知道，他自称在服药。不管真相如何，(这一举动)鲁莽、鲁莽、鲁莽。” 毕竟，“羟氯喹热”曾酿出过悲剧。在亚利桑那州，一对年过六旬的夫妇为预防感染新冠病毒，服用了鱼缸清洁剂，因为他们认为其中含有的“磷酸氯喹”，就是“电视上一直讨论的药物”，最终导致一人死亡、一人病危。有美媒称，他们的这一行为是因为相信总统的建议。 据《纽约邮报》报道，3月中旬，在eBay等电商平台上，含相关成分的鱼缸清洁剂的销量大涨，价格一度从此前9.99美元，涨至519美元。 美国多方也急忙喊话民众，勿乱服药。 前计划生育主席温蕾娜表示，“这种药物有严重的副作用。”她称，自己非常担心特朗普继续作出示范进行服药，伤害更多的美国民众。 美国保护医疗保险委员会的执行董事罗布·戴维森则指出，特朗普已经要为成千上万人的死亡负责，“不要再增加这一数字了”。   资料图：当地时间5月14日，美国总统特朗普在未戴口罩的情况下视察了宾夕法尼亚一家医疗物资分配中心，在人群中尤其显眼。   【“歪主意”何时休？】 除了盲目地宣传羟氯喹疗效，自美国疫情暴发以来，白宫已经放出了不少误导性言论。 注射消毒剂杀病毒？ 4月23日，特朗普曾提出可以尝试“注射消毒剂”疗法，遭强烈反对。一家知名消毒剂制造商甚至发声明辟谣，要求民众“在任何情况下，都不要把我们的产品注入人体”。不过第二天，特朗普就试图收回该说法，称自己只是在进行“讽刺”。 究竟戴不戴口罩？ 在戴口罩的议题上，特朗普也被指玩“双标”。白宫疫情暴发后，特朗普终于在5月11日明确要求白宫工作人员戴口罩。然而，在当天的记者会上，特朗普本人是唯一不戴口罩的人。5月14日，他在视察宾夕法尼亚时，也坚持不戴口罩，被指“树立了一个坏榜样”。 无视专业意见 日前，美国各地接连“解封”，白宫发布了复工复产指南，却被认为笼统、缺乏操作性建议。但事实上，美国疾控中心曾编写了一份指南，详列了餐厅酒吧、办公场所、公共交通等公共场所逐步开放的准则，却被白宫认为“拘泥于细节”“太死板”，而遭“封杀”。 英国《金融时报》19日刊文称，特朗普本可以阻止数以万计人死亡，但他没有，却仍在声称“美国领导世界”。历史将会记住，在处理新冠疫情的问题上，美国第一次没能发挥领导作用。（完）  “掌”握科技鲜闻 （微信搜索techsina或扫描左侧二维码关注） 新浪科技 新浪科技为你带来最新鲜的科技资讯 苹果汇 苹果汇为你带来最新鲜的苹果产品新闻 新浪众测 新酷产品第一时间免费试玩 新浪探索 提供最新的科学家新闻，精彩的震撼图片 新浪科技意见反馈留言板 电话：400-052-0066 欢迎批评指正 新浪简介|广告服务|About Sina\n联系我们|招聘信息|通行证注册\n产品答疑|网站律师|SINA English Copyright © 1996-2020 SINA Corporation All Rights Reserved 新浪公司 版权所有",

    "[] 原标题：美医生组织齐声谴责：退出WHO毫无逻辑 将产生有害影响 中新网5月30日电 综合报道，当地时间29日，美国总统特朗普表示，美国将终止与世界卫生组织的关系，并称该组织未能对新冠疫情做出充分反应。美国国内医生组织谴责称，此举将导致全球对抗新冠病毒大流行的努力愈发艰难。 【特朗普宣布将终止与世卫组织的关系】 特朗普29日说：“由于他们(世卫组织)未能进行(美方)所要求的和急需的改革，我们今天将终止与世界卫生组织的关系，并将(提供给世卫组织的)资重新分配给其他国家，以及迫切需要的全球公共卫生需求上。”   当地时间5月21日，美国总统特朗普在密歇根州福特工厂视察时被媒体拍到仍未佩戴口罩，而此前，不管是福特公司还是该州官员都提出了希望他戴口罩的要求。   目前还不清楚特朗普的决定何时生效。1948年，美国国会通过了一项有关美国加入世界卫生组织的联合决议。决议说，美国“保留在提前一年通知的情况下，退出世界卫生组织的权利”。 5月18日，特朗普致信给世卫组织总干事谭德赛，称如果世界卫生组织在30天内不按照美国的要求进行改革，那么美国将全面停止资助世卫组织。 谭德塞20日表示，三年前世卫组织已开始转型，力争扩大捐助基础，提高资金“质量”，希望可以解决面临的资金挑战。 美国原为世卫组织最大捐助国，每年提供大约4亿美元，约占该组织预算的15%。世卫组织的运作向来依靠成员国的会费，以及各国与非营利组织的自愿性捐款。 【美国内专家发声谴责】 特朗普宣布退出的决定很快在美国国内遭到谴责。 据彭博社29日报道，美国医学会主席帕特里斯·哈里斯表示：“在一场已经导致逾10万美国人死亡的全球疫情下，切断与世界卫生组织的关系毫无逻辑可言，这使得寻找解决这场公共卫生危机的方法变得有更多挑战。” 哈里斯说：“这种毫无意义的行动将产生重大的、有害的影响……特别是在世卫组织领导全球疫苗开发和药物试验以对抗新冠病毒大流行的情况下。” 截至美东时间5月27日晚，美国新冠死亡病例已经超过10万例，但这场危机几乎仍未显示出缓和的迹象。图为当地时间5月27日，一名男子跑步途径美国弗吉尼亚州阿灵顿市阿灵顿国家公墓外。 参议院卫生委员会主席拉马尔·亚历山大也说，他不同意特朗普的决定。 路透社30日报道称，约翰斯·霍普金斯大学健康安全中心的高级学者阿达贾表示，特朗普的决定不太可能改变世界卫生组织的运作。 她说：“从象征性或道德的角度来看，在新冠病毒大流行期间采取这种行动是错误的，这似乎转移了美国自身失误的责任，转而指责世卫组织。” 【国际舆论“力挺”世卫组织】 今年4月，特朗普宣布美国暂停向世卫组织缴纳会费，并要求对世卫组织在疫情中的行为问责。该行为持续遭到多方批驳。 4月16日，《纽约时报》发文称：世卫组织是特朗普寻找的“替罪羊”，该组织向来谨慎，其行动比许多国家政府更有力、更快速。 文章称，世卫组织早已为世界敲响警钟。随着疫情发展和时间的推移，世卫组织希望大家团结一致携手抗疫的决心更加强烈。疫情出现后，世卫组织一直呼吁世界各国认真对待。 多国政要及国际组织也曾对特朗普发出批评。联合国秘书长古特雷斯说，世界卫生组织必须得到支持，这对全球战胜新冠疫情的努力绝对关键。德国总理默克尔也呼吁加强国际合作，共同抗击新冠疫情，并表示德国将全力支持世界卫生组织。 4月27日，美国国会众议院外交委员会宣布，将启动针对特朗普政府暂停缴纳世界卫生组织会费的调查。 该委员会主席、民主党人恩格尔表示，当前新冠肺炎疫情正在全球肆虐，暂停向世卫缴纳会费是将“生命置于危险之中”，对抗世卫而不是疫情“只会让已经糟糕的情况雪上加霜”，对控制疫情扩散起到反作用。  “掌”握科技鲜闻 （微信搜索techsina或扫描左侧二维码关注） 新浪科技 新浪科技为你带来最新鲜的科技资讯 苹果汇 苹果汇为你带来最新鲜的苹果产品新闻 新浪众测 新酷产品第一时间免费试玩 新浪探索 提供最新的科学家新闻，精彩的震撼图片 新浪科技意见反馈留言板 电话：400-052-0066 欢迎批评指正 新浪简介|广告服务|About Sina\n联系我们|招聘信息|通行证注册\n产品答疑|网站律师|SINA English Copyright © 1996-2020 SINA Corporation All Rights Reserved 新浪公司 版权所有",

    "[] 原标题：华为5G被打压，三星抢市场？不存在的，只有华为、中兴抢别人市场 来源：互联网乱侃秀 众所周知，从2018年年开始，华为5G就被美国打压，不仅美国还有很多美国的盟友都开始拒绝华为5G，连带着拒绝中兴。 然后三星趁机刷了一波存在感，尤其在美国的通信市场，三星确实取得了一些成绩，再加上韩国本土的5G建设，也让三星收获了一波市场。 于是很多人说，华为被打压，再加上中兴也有被打压的迹象，三星趁机崛起抢市场，三星有可能超过中兴，成为全球第四大通信设备厂商。 但三星真的能够趁机抢市场？其实是不存在的，近日Dell'Oro Group刚刚发布了2020年第一季度全球电信设备整体市场报告。 这份报告涵盖了宽带接入、微波与光传输、移动核心网和无线接入网（RAN）、SP路由器和CE交换机（运营商以太网交换机）在内的整个电信设备市场，也包含了2G3G4G5G等等。 从数据来看，华为份额高达28%，是诺基亚（15%）和爱立信（14%）之和，而中兴通讯（11%）排名第四，思科（6%）排名第五，三星连前五都没份。 而从2019的数据来看，排名和份额也差不太多，前五名也是这5家厂商，收入分别为29%、16%、14%、10%和7%，三星一样没有进入前5名。所以所谓的三星趁机抢走市场，这样的情况是不存在的。 不仅如此，从市场的发展趋势来看，整个市场在下滑，而华为保持住了，中兴在增长，而诺基亚、爱立信、思科都在下滑，可见只有华为、中兴抢别人的市场，哪轮到三星这样的“小角色”来抢华为、中兴的市场？ 24小时滚动播报最新的财经资讯和视频，更多粉丝福利扫描二维码关注（sinafinance） 新浪财经意见反馈留言板 电话：400-052-0066 欢迎批评指正 新浪简介|广告服务|About Sina\n联系我们|招聘信息|通行证注册\n产品答疑|网站律师|SINA English Copyright © 1996-2020 SINA Corporation All Rights Reserved 新浪公司 版权所有",
    "[] 原标题：北美观察丨黑人遭暴力执法后带来愤怒与承诺 但没带来改变 当地时间6月13日，美国《纽约时报》刊登文章，对弗洛伊德之死是否能够带来美国执法机构真正的改变感到担忧。 2014年，迈克尔·布朗遭到警察暴力执法身亡。随后数以百万计的美元被用于对警方行为进行修正，可改变却甚少。 弗洛伊德之死会有所不同吗？ 2014年弗格森事件之后 在弗洛伊德事件前，美国就已经经历过类似的事件：黑人男子在沥青地面上，死于警察之手。全国掀起了愤怒的抗议浪潮。美国陷入沉思，誓言作出改变。类似事件上一次发生在2014年8月，受害者叫做迈克尔·布朗（Michael Brown），警察名叫达伦·威尔逊（Darren Wilson），密苏里州弗格森就是事发地点。 自从那次致命枪击导致的抗议暴发后，警察部门投入了数千万美元，增加警方随身摄像头、更改使用武力的政策、举办消除隐性偏见及缓和局势的培训。时任总统奥巴马成立了工作组，祭出153项建议和行动指南，司法部强迫七个有问题的警察部门签署“同意判定”（Consent decrees），规定了旨在减少种族差别对待和警察暴力的强制性标准。 布朗先生的尸体被遗弃在街头数小时后的六年，另一名非裔美国人——乔治·弗洛伊德（George Floyd），在明尼阿波利斯警官用膝盖锁住他的脖子时，乞求饶命。他的死亡就像一个判决书：重塑美国警务的计划已经失败。 讽刺的是，明尼阿波利斯警察局作为联邦增加对刑事司法系统信任程度的试点部门，本身就是该计划的受益者。曾参与该项目的警务专家大卫·肯尼迪（David Kennedy）说，计划确实发挥了一定影响，但这个计划“绝对、明显而透彻，是不够的”。 人们态度已经变了，确实。当时批评警察的人当选权职。一些警局减少了逮捕人数，重新考虑了拦截和搜查政策，减少了警察枪击事件。将人们转移到社会服务而不是监狱的测试也有所成功。 但最重要的数字，如每年被警方枪击致死的总人数，却没有任何变化。即使各部门从武力执法行动中抽身，他们也经常发现，明显的种族差异依然存在，甚至更加严重。 一份联邦报告发现，弗格森警方未能理解当地社群存在问题，并使用“无效和不适当的策略”，比如在不稳定且没有警告的情况下使用催泪瓦斯，使那里的紧张局势升级 ——而现在，这种策略似乎已在全美各地扩散。 尽管每次有黑人男子或妇女无谓地死于执法部门手中时，都会有新的紧迫感，但为非裔社区发声的人们发现，变革的速度简直慢如冰川移动。 “我们已经有这么多的工作组、有这么多的建议。”菲兰多·卡斯蒂尔（Philando Castile）的母亲瓦莱丽·卡斯蒂尔（Valerie Castile）如是说。在弗格森抗议活动两年后，菲兰多·卡斯蒂尔在明尼阿波利斯郊区的一次交通拦截中遭到致命枪击。在检察创新研究所（Institute for Innovation in Prosecution）主持的在线讨论中，卡斯蒂尔母亲说：“我已经空谈了四年，但现在我又发现面对同样的情况。而且我认为我们已经做了所有能想到的和能做的事，但是这一切都没有实施。” 最近几天，有抗议者呼吁削减警察部门的资金或完全废除它们。但这也留下了一个问题，即弗洛伊德去世后，重新呼吁改革是否会真的会出现持久的变化。 此前，即使是量化问题的尝试，也没有达到预期的效果。联邦调查局的一个数据库追踪了弗格森等案件中警方使用武力的情况，这个数据库将在今年夏天首次公开。即便花了5年时间才建立起来，但这个数据库也仅包括了全国40%的警察而已。 美国会民主党人在上周提出的一项法案将要求执法机构报告使用武力的数据。在弗格森案中，布朗死后，国会授权对类似于弗洛伊德一样在警察执法期间的死亡进行了统计，但该统计已经落后于原定时间表。 尽管得到了广泛的支持，但在警察的招募、培训或使用武力方面仍然缺乏国家标准。 报告层出不穷，改革层出不穷。明尼阿波利斯警察局在近日同意禁止“锁颈”的动作，并要求警察在看到不当行为时进行干预。但早在弗格森枪击案发生后的几年里，该部门其实就已经确立了干预的职责。 即使在最近的佐治亚州布伦瑞克（Brunswick）市艾哈迈德·阿贝里（Ahmaud Arbery）、肯塔基州路易斯维尔布里昂纳·泰勒（Breonna Talyor）和弗洛伊德的死亡事件之前，参与重塑警察部门的专家们也没有幻想他们已经取得了足够的进展。那些旨在进行改革的警察部门领导人，一直受到巨大的阻挠，州的法律、工会反对和对被指控行为不当的官员的合同保护。 现政府在毁掉此前的努力 专家们说，在前总统奥巴马领导下，联邦改善警务工作努力的领导力，在特朗普总统的领导下被毁于一旦。 由于对警察军事化的担忧，奥巴马政府限制了一项向警察部门提供额外设备的计划，这些设备包括手榴弹发射器和装甲车，但特朗普取消了该限制。 奥巴马政府接受了使用“同意判定”（consent decrees），即解决双方争议的协议指出问题——由第三方监督的具有强制性、可衡量的计划——来清理有问题的部门。“同意判定”是有关各方以书面形式向法院提交的协议。一旦被法官批准，它就具有法律约束力。使用“同意判定”使得各地执法人员面临整个部门被强制改革的压力，因此让部分执法人员更加小心行事。 曾在奥巴马政府期间领导警察部门调查的前司法部官员克里斯蒂·洛佩兹（Christy E。 Lopez）说：“\n经验表明，在许多情况下，只要有一项‘\n同意判定\n’，就能克服根深蒂固的种族主义和工会反对等障碍。\n” 尽管在全美18000个警察部门中，只有极小的比例曾经受到过相关政策的约束，但它们设定了一个基调，确立了最佳做法，并让警察部门高级别官员注意到，如果他们表现出侵犯公民权利的“模式和做法”，他们也可能受到审查。 “联邦政府和司法部的领导力是不可替代的。”洛佩兹说。 然而，特朗普政府结束了这个政策的使用，并大大缩减了一个受欢迎的自愿计划——合作改革倡议，该计划帮助各部门减少警察枪击事件等。 司法部长威廉·巴尔（William P。 Barr）曾将警察滥用行为归咎于队伍中的“坏苹果”，并表示对警察的批评让那些不尊重法律的人得到壮胆。“我不认为执法系统有系统性种族歧视。”他上周日（6月7日）在电视采访中说。 2017年，司法部破坏性地出具了一份报告，关于芝加哥警方可能导致更积极联邦监督。随后，美国开始了结束奥巴马“同意判定”政策的行动。当伊利诺伊州总检察长丽萨·马迪甘（Lisa Madigan）出面将警察部门置于州“同意判定”之下后，时任特朗普政府的司法部长杰夫·塞申斯（Jeff Sessions）在联邦法院反对此举，即便他曾表示警察监督应该是州和地方的责任。 5月，西雅图要求解除自2012年以来的“同意判定”，称自己是一个改革后的机构。但在弗洛伊德示威开始后，在该市收到数千份关于其官员行动的投诉后，改变了主意。 “同意判定”的执行往往令人沮丧地缓慢，即便诸如要求警方给人名片这样的小变化也会遭到反对。不过，在旧金山和芝加哥等地，这些法令还是取得了明显的效果。在旧金山，从2016年第一季度到2020年第一季度，警察使用武力事件减少了近一半，而武力对象中黑人的比例从47人下降到37人。 在芝加哥，2015年至2019年间，使用武力事件有所下降，枪击事件减少了近一半。但武力执法的主体为非裔美国人的比例一直保持在70%以上，作为对比，该市人口中非裔美国人占30%。 专家表示，普通民众并不是一个很好的数据基准值，因为大多数人并不与警察产生互动。一项关于犯罪活动的致命警察枪击案研究发现，总体上没有种族差异，但研究表示黑人受害者更有可能手无寸铁，不构成直接威胁，而白人受害者则更有可能挑起警察伤害他们，俗称“被警察自杀”（Suicide by cops）。 在路上拦截是另一种方式。《纽约时报》4年前的调查发现，北卡罗来纳州格林斯博罗市的警察拦截黑人驾车者比例非常高。4年后，根据开放数据，虽然拦截总数有所下降，但比例几乎没有变化。该部门在2019年搜查黑人司机的可能性是白人司机的4倍多，两者比4年前的差距更大。在这两个群体中，警方报告发现违禁品的可能为三分之一。 改革真的就这么难？ 明尼阿波利斯本身就是一项研究，说明即使领导人想要改变，改变是多么缓慢。这座以对非裔美国人过度使用武力而闻名的城市，曾连续聘请了两位被誉为改革者的警察局长。警察部门对员工进行了隐性偏见、和解和“程序正义”方面的培训，重点是警察如何对待公众。该市已经彻底改革了其纪律制度，并邀请联邦对其早期干预系统（Early Intervention System）进行审查，该系统应该对需要进行相关培训的警员进行界定和标注。 与弗格森事件不同的是，与弗洛伊德死亡相关的警察很快就被确认并被解雇，然后被刑事指控。但这并没有阻止抗议的发生和市议会成员计划完全解散现有部门。 警察工会在警察使用武力后，对警察负责的后果进行限制特别努力。得克萨斯州奥斯汀市的警察改革倡导者凯西·米切尔（Kathy Mitchell）说，近年来，各团体都在试图强调缓和冲突，并采取行动缩小警察可以使用致命武力的标准。 奥斯汀警察协会主席肯·卡萨代（Ken Casaday）说，但工会却在与这一努力反抗，因为官员们认为这将使警官的生命处于危险之中。 米切尔说，结果是在缓和冲突和使用武力的政策中，警察收到混乱的信息。 “我们取得一项成果，就会有负面信息来磨灭这些成果。”她说。 旨在让警察接受社区监督的民间审查委员会成员们，常年抱怨他们没有任何权力。 在西雅图，该市社区警察委员会前主席丽萨·道戈德（Lisa Daugaard）说，该小组建议警方在经过审核前，暂停使用闪光弹来驱散抗议者。但警方仍然继续广泛使用这些物品。警察局长说，她也想不使用，但警察应该有这种工具可用。 “我们已经习惯了我们的建议百分之百被忽视。”道戈德说。 在明尼苏达州圣保罗市，康斯坦斯·塔克（Constance Tuck）说，她去年辞去了该市警民内务审查委员会主席的职务，因为她发现该市正在削弱这个委员会的权力，尽管市长办公室表示，仍将该委员会视为重要工具。 最近几天，要求减少警察工会权力或迫使其改变的压力越来越大。部分现任和前任检察官呼吁加利福尼亚州律师协会改变其道德规则，禁止检察官，或那些竞选工作的人，寻求或接受警察工会的政治捐款。 在西雅图，将当地工会聚集在一起，作为一个单位进行活动的金县（King County）劳工委员会在6月通过了一项决议，称除非西雅图警察协会愿意承认种族主义是执法部门的结构性问题，并致力于确保工会合同“不逃避法律的责任”，否则可能会被踢出劳工委员会。 但许多抗议者已经对渐进式变革失去了耐心，废除或停止资助警察的呼吁，曾经是一个激进的解决方案，最近却被各方放大，被官员接受。 乔内塔·埃尔齐（Johnetta Elzie）是一名抗议者，2014年在弗格森事件抗议中被使用催泪瓦斯，上周在华盛顿特区再次被使用了催泪瓦斯。她对重新塑造公共安全而不是修正警察问题的呼声渐响感到欣慰。“你知道，如果警察们训练有效，”她说，“我们怎么会还在这抗议？” “我一直觉得今天这一切似曾相识，”她补充道，“特别似曾相识。” 责任编辑：张建利 扫描左侧二维码下载，更多精彩内容随你看。（官方微博：新浪新闻） 违法和不良信息举报电话：4000520066\n举报邮箱：jubao@vip.sina.com Copyright © 1996-2020 SINA Corporation All Rights Reserved 新浪公司 版权所有",

    "[] WASHINGTON – It’s a highly classified dossier outlining the most urgent and credible national security threats of the day. And that top-secret document is suddenly in the spotlight. The president’s daily intelligence brief, or PDB, is now at the center of a firestorm over reports that Russia offered bounties to Taliban militants to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan. The White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said Monday that President Donald Trump was not \"personally briefed\" on intelligence about the alleged Russian operation. But McEnany would not say whether that explosive information was relayed to Trump in his daily written intelligence briefing, which he does not usually read, according to multiple media reports. McEnany on Tuesday disputed assertions that Trump doesn't read his daily intelligence briefings. She also said there are disagreements among U.S. intelligence officials about the credibility of the Russian bounty intelligence, in trying to explain why Trump was not orally told about it. So what is the presidential daily brief? And how does Trump get his intelligence information, if he does not always read the written digest delivered to him every day? According to the CIA, the PDB has been presented to every president since Feb. 15, 1946, when then-President Harry Truman received what was then known as \"the Daily Summary,\" chock full of secret warnings and classified insights about the most urgent threats against the United States. The format is customized to each new president – to match reading preferences and the way information is absorbed. \"Some presidents prefer to have it all told to them, some prefer to read it,\" said Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer and now Democratic congresswoman. \"It's really an issue of how does the consumer – in this case the president – get the information that's necessary.\" Presidents are also assigned a briefer who becomes accustomed to the desired format and can anticipate what questions the commander-in-chief might ask. In the current administration, the written PDB can be anywhere from 18 to 75 pages, depending on what is going on in the world at a particular time, said two administration officials speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. The report is divided into specific issue areas, such as COVID-19 or Afghanistan, and often includes charts, graphs, and bullet points. The written briefing is distributed across the government, and more than 100 people beyond Trump can have access to it, from the Pentagon to the State Department, the officials said. The intelligence community presents conclusions in the written PDB with different degrees of confidence, from low to high, officials said. Only items that carry a high degree of confidence are presented in person to the president, and that did not include reports that Russia may be paying bounties for the deaths of U.S. soldiers. Officials declined to say whether Trump read about that allegation in the PDB, or how closely he reads the documents in general. They did say there are government officials who do not believe there is enough evidence to prove that Russia is actually paying bounties. They did not specify who those officials are or how many there are. Trump’s primary briefer is Beth Sanner, who carries the title of Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Mission Integration. Officials said the president also talks intelligence matters with department heads such as National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. To produce the PDB, intelligence officials work through the night to sift through a constantly churning stream of intelligence information and determine what the president needs to know. \"Then the PDB briefers come in in the very wee hours of the morning to get themselves up to speed on what's in it\" and prepare themselves to present it to the president, said Carol Rollie Flynn, a 30-year CIA veteran. The PDB also usually goes to the president's top national security advisers, such as his secretaries of defense and state. Former President George W. Bush took the printed copy and then had his briefer walk him through it, Flynn said. \"He liked to have his full team there, so it was a real conversation every day,\" said Flynn, who is now with the Foreign Policy Research Institute. In 2014, intelligence officials switched from a printed PDB to an electronic one at the request of then-President Barack Obama, according to a CIA history of the PDB. Robert Cardillo, a former intelligence official and PDB briefer in the Obama administration, said he considered two questions when assembling the president’s daily brief: \"Does the president need to know this? And if the answer's yes, does the president need to know this now?” Cardillo said Obama wanted his PDB delivered by 6 am. He would read it then and have an oral briefing on the material a few hours later. The main PDB is usually less than 20 pages long, according to David Priess, a former CIA officer and presidential briefer who served in the  Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. \"And for 55 years, *every* POTUS (possibly excepting of Nixon) has read it,\" Priess tweeted on Monday amid the escalating controversy of whether Trump knew about the Russian bounty report. The New York Times has reported that intelligence information outlining the Russian bounty operation was included in Trump's PDB in February. The Associated Press reported that Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, told colleagues that he briefed Trump on the intelligence assessment in March 2019. Like his predecessors, Trump also gets regular in-person briefings from members of the intelligence community. This is Trump's preferred method of getting intelligence information, and it happens about two or three times a week, according to daily schedules released by the White House. Trump is often briefed by Sanner, who was appointed deputy director of national intelligence for mission integration in May 2019. Trump rarely seemed to absorb the intelligence information even when he was orally briefed, according to Bolton's new book, \"The Room Where It Happened,\" released last week. “Trump generally had only two intelligence briefings per week, and in most of those, he spoke at greater length than the briefers, often on matters completely unrelated to the subjects at hand,” Bolton writes in the book. Experts say that U.S. intelligence officials should have alerted Trump to the Russia bounty intelligence in whatever form he prefers, given the grave threat to American troops in the field. Cardillo said intelligence officials have what’s called a “duty to warn” if they come upon information that American lives are at risk from a foreign actor. That means, he said, that information goes up the chain “almost immediately” and often without being fully vetted because it’s so important. Frank Kendall, a former undersecretary for Defense, said it would be \"career-ending\" for an intelligence official not to relay that kind of information. “When soldiers’ lives are at stake, there's a very strong burden and a very high priority” to relay that information, Kendall said. “And not providing that sort of information would be at least career-ending for people if it was found out later on that they had it and had not it passed on.” As with warnings about the coronavirus pandemic, it seems to have fallen through the cracks, said John Gans, author of \"White House Warriors: How the National Security Council Transformed the American Way of War.\" \"The hints of threats are being seen, warnings are being sounded, but neither the president nor anyone else are heeding them,\" said John Gans, author of \"White House Warriors: How the National Security Council Transformed the American Way of War.\" Rep. Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the intelligence about potential Russian bounties was likely included in the president's daily brief but not conveyed to Trump in a formal threat briefing because it wasn't yet \"actionable.\" McCaul made the remarks to NBC, and his office confirmed them with USA TODAY. \"I think the way the process works is that he (Trump) gets briefed about three times a week on sort of actionable, credible items,\" McCaul told NBC. \"And the decision was made that this was not at that point in time a credible, actionable piece of intelligence. And if at any point it did, it would be raised to his attention.\" 'Nonsense': Election experts reject Trump's claims of possible counterfeit ballots Intelligence gathering is like 'putting together a tapestry' Flynn said it's no surprise if there were disagreements among U.S. intelligence agencies and analysts about the reliability of the information about Russia's alleged operation. \"What happens a lot when you get this kind of information, it's fragmentary,\" she said. \"You get a little bit from one person, a little bit from another, maybe a little bit from an intercept. And you're kind of putting it together like a tapestry, and usually there's some holes here and there.\" She said it sounds like that is what happened with the Russian bounty intelligence. And because it's so alarming and provocative, she said, \"you want to be really careful that you don't give it more credibility than it deserves.\" She noted that once such information is relayed to the president, it could lead retaliatory action or another major policy decision. But Spanberger and others said any information in the president's daily brief must be deemed urgent and credible. And if that's the case with the Russian bounty information – and intelligence officials knew Trump would not read the PDB – then they should have told the president directly about it. Republican Sen. Todd Young, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was \"alarmed\" that Trump was not briefed on the intelligence information. He suggested intelligence officials should be held \"accountable for their gross negligence\" for failing to alert the president, and he called for congressional hearings to probe the Russia allegations. \"We must work to ascertain the reliability of media reports and, where necessary, advance accountability within our own government and facilitate a punishing response to the seemingly immoral, illegal, and unconscionable actions of the dictator who lords over the Russian people,\" Young, of Indiana, said in a statement Monday. This report in particular should have been flagged for Trump because of the importance of U.S.-Russian relations and the potential threat to American military personnel, said Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican who sits on the Senate intelligence committee. \"What we’re talking about here is putting the target crosshairs on the backs of American servicemen and women in uniform,\" Sasse told reporters Monday. He said Congress should be focused on two questions:  \"No. 1, Who knew what, when, and did the commander-in-chief know? And if not, how the hell not?\" Spanberger said whether Trump was briefed or not, \"we all know now,\" as she put in in a tweet. So the real question, she said, is \"how are we going to act\" on the information? What we know:Russia reportedly offered bounty on US troops in Afghanistan.

    "[] Ever since I was a little boy, the other boys never called me “John” or “Johnny” or even “Roberts.” It was always “John Roberts.” The words would always run together, so in essence my name, to one and all, was “JohnRoberts.” “JohnRoberts, did you hear wrestling practice was canceled?” “JohnRoberts, Father Reilly said he wants to see you after Mass.” “JohnRoberts, do you want to go to the Dairy Queen for a root beer?” (Root was the only kind of beer I drank.) I did consider it a little strange when my own father started calling me “JohnRoberts,” but I didn’t mind. It was simply a gesture of respect for my immense propriety. I wanted to impress my elders with my rectitude, and I think I did. I impressed the other students too. I know I was not seen the way the other boys were. People didn’t ask me, “Hey, JohnRoberts, want to go get high and see Gimme Shelter?” More often they would ask me for my opinion about cross-comparing the various options in life-insurance annuities or what model sedan I considered the most decorous and respectable. (Buick. Always Buick.) Often a group of boys would approach me, and one boy in the group would ask me these kinds of questions while his friends stood around, snickering at some private joke to which I was not privy. In retrospect, I suppose these were strange questions to ask a high schooler, but then again, it was my practice to wear long, black silken robes everywhere I went, just to be prepared for my future. I guess you could say young Kavanaugh did enough youthful hijinks for the both of us. He once told me he went to see Porky’s when he was only 16 and a half! Can you imagine? He’s a card, that boy. Sometimes the fellows would ask me for my philosophy of life, which is intertwined with my legal philosophy, which is what I want to speak to you about today. I know that some of you are calling attention to how, when the liberals have five votes without me, I sometimes let forth a mighty roar denouncing the irreparable harm to our constitutional fabric, but when the liberals have only four votes without me, I tend to join them, while issuing a meek, technicality-filled ruling explaining why I’m unable to do anything conservative because, well, that’s just how the law works. I know that some of you are calling my judicial philosophy “Loserism” behind my back, and that is hurtful to me. Our side is not “losing.” That’s preposterous. I prefer the term “alternative winning.” Let me explain how alternative winning works. This week, though I did stop the liberals from singling out religious schools for punishment in Montana, I know I disappointed conservatives when I voted the wrong way about abortion (again) and even voted against myself, just four years ago on a very similar case. What you don’t give me enough credit for is quoting Edmund Burke in my decision. Burke, I need not remind you, is a conservative icon. You think you would have gotten a Burke reference out of Sotomayor or Kagan? No, that’s what JohnRoberts gave you. I don’t merely let our adversaries whip conservatives about the head and neck with rusty chains, I quote Edmund Burke while I join them in whipping conservatives about the head and neck with rusty chains. Burke should warm your heart as you pass into unconsciousness because your spinal column feels like it’s being stomped on by orcs. Alternative winning. Some of you have pointed out that when I joined the liberals to save Obamacare eight years ago by declaring that the penalty for not complying with the individual mandate was a tax, I not only disagreed with the people who wrote the law but switched sides at the last minute. It wounded me when some of you described this as “chickening out.” I prefer to think of it as “alternative courage.” As I said at the time, “It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices,” even constitutionally dodgy ones. You vote it, you got it! When it comes to American voters enacting any limits on abortion whatsoever, though, it is most definitely my job to save American voters from the policies they vote for. You vote it, you must be stopped! The rules, as Elena Kagan has so helpfully explained to me, are straightforward enough: Abortion is not in the Constitution, but it’s implied by the right to privacy, which is also not in the Constitution, but the implications within these non-specified rights are super-specific. Even down to the level of whether Louisiana medical professionals doing abortions must be held to the same standards as Louisiana medical professionals doing LASIK: This question was settled for all time back in 1787. Though I was on the opposite side of this particular question in 2016, the doctrine known as stare decisis means I am not allowed to agree with 2016 me. Stare decisis, of course, is Latin for “I can’t do anything hard.” True, I voted to overturn longstanding precedents in Citizens United v. FEC (2010), Janus v. AFSCME (2018), and Knick v. Township of Scott (2019), which means “respects the precedent” goes out the window when I’m feeling up to doing my job. You might say that it is our duty as Justices to drop-kick bad precedents, as we have done throughout the whole history of the country. Sometimes I do that! If it’s not too hard. But the Louisiana case is quite hard, because it’s about abortion. You may have noticed that when the liberals don’t get what they want on abortion, they turn . . . grouchy. This matters, because they get to write all of the newspaper stories and history books. It is therefore my considered judgment that if I did anything that made it the least bit difficult for any American to get an abortion, my well-earned reputation for judiciousness would suddenly be worth about as much as a Jefferson Davis statue in Harlem. It is my settled view that no one should ever be mad at JohnRoberts, pillar of rectitudinous propriety. Fellows, I worked really hard to be boring. My passion in school was Latin. Do you think I want there to be a chapter in the history books dedicated to hating JohnRoberts? The U.S. is one of the seven most permissive countries on earth for abortion. That may be unfortunate, but as long as it stays that way, no one’s dragging an effigy of JohnRoberts through the streets.

    "[] Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) has been the object of liberal ire since her 2018 vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Now in a tight re-election fight, whatever hopes she might have had of putting that episode behind her were dashed this week, when now-Justice Kavanaugh cast a dissenting vote in the Supreme Court’s latest decision to uphold the legal framework that grants access to women seeking abortions. But the legacy of Collins’ vote on Kavanaugh hasn’t been all bad for the longtime Maine senator. In fact, it’s appeared to earn her some powerful and deep-pocketed new allies. Collins, who’s staked out a brand as a pro-choice moderate Republican over her nearly 24 years in the Senate, has historically never been a favorite in the conservative legal circles embodied by the Federalist Society, a leading group of right-of-center attorneys and legal thinkers. But that, apparently, has changed dramatically since Collins’ fateful vote. Since 2019, Collins’ campaign and two associated political action committees have raked in nearly $200,000 from donors who are also high-dollar contributors to the Federalist Society. Many of those who gave to Collins had never cut a check for her before. New Kavanaugh Book: Sen. Feinstein Dithered on Ford Letter The group of 39 donors includes Leonard Leo, the former executive vice president of the Federalist Society and a driving force behind President Trump and the Senate GOP’s historically successful efforts to stock the federal bench with conservative judges. Leo and his wife, Sally—neither of whom had previously donated to Collins—each gave the maximum $5,600 to Collins’ campaign committee last year. Half of Leo’s support came by way of a joint fundraising committee supporting three other Senate Republicans. Last summer, Leo hosted a fundraiser for Collins at his newly bought Maine vacation home, an event that appeared to open up more Federalist Society funds for the senator. Leo was one of five Federalist Society-associated first-time donors to Collins, a group that also included Daniel Casey. Casey is the president of the Judicial Crisis Network, a group with ties to the Federalist Society that led the charge for Kavanaugh’s confirmation. GOP mega-donors linked to the group also got on board with Collins after her vote. Philip Anschutz, the billionaire whose foundation supports the Federalist Society, gave $5,600, the per-cycle maximum, to Collins’ campaign. Others were not first-time Collins donors but dramatically stepped up their giving this year. In 2019, Bernard Marcus, co-founder of Home Depot, and his wife Billi Wilma gave a total of $20,800 to Collins’ campaign and to her leadership PAC. The couple’s foundation is part of the Federalist Society’s Madison Club, the honorific bestowed on its major donors. Marcus is in the Club’s Platinum Level, reserved for those who give $100,000 or more. Previously, the couple had donated a total of $3,000 to Collins across her 2014 and 2008 re-election campaigns. Support for Collins from C. Boyden Gray, a former counsel to President George H.W. Bush and a Federalist Society board member, also illustrates the evolving relationship between the senator and the conservative legal group. In 2003, Gray’s conservative advocacy group ran controversial ads in Maine pressuring the senator to vote in favor of a conservative Bush nominee, William Pryor, Jr., to the bench. Ultimately, Collins was one of just two Republican senators to vote against Pryor. After giving $3,600 to her 2014 effort, Gray has given nearly $8,000 to Collins’ political outfit since her Kavanaugh vote. Susan Collins’ Obama-Era Vote Against Pandemic Funding Comes Back to Haunt Her Most of the donations from Federalist Society backers went directly to Collins’ campaign. Some also supported Collins’ leadership PAC, which she can use to dole out funds to allies and help build political capital. Others financed the Collins Victory Committee, a joint fundraising account supporting both her campaign and her leadership PAC. The groundswell in financial support that Collins is receiving from conservative legal bigwigs comes at a time when the nation’s courts have become increasingly politicized. Kavanaugh’s nomination became a rallying point for many Democrats and Democratic-allied groups. And Collins’ support for it—which culminated in a nationally watched Senate floor speech—put a target squarely on her back. While those invested in the confirmation rushed to offer their appreciation, progressives began fundraising for her challenger immediately, raising more than four million dollars before Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon even became the Democratic frontrunner. The end result has been one of the more expensive and tightly fought Senate races of the cycle, with Collins facing a serious challenge for a seat she has held comfortably since 1996. The senator’s campaign has raised over $10.3 million since January 2019; Gideon, meanwhile, has raised over $14.8 million in the same time period. Collins has $1 million more in the bank, however. “Senator Collins has always received strong support from across the ideological spectrum,” Kevin Kelley, a spokesman for Collins’ campaign, told The Daily Beast. “Bribery doesn’t work on Senator Collins,” Kelley added, in reference to the money raised by liberal groups around her Kavanaugh vote. “She made up her mind based on the merits of the nomination. It’s laughable that the same people who tried to buy Senator Collins’ vote for more than $4 million now appear to be suggesting that she sold her vote for far less.” The Federalist Society did not respond to a request for comment. But a source close to the Kavanaugh confirmation process described the donations as an organic show of support for a senator crucial to getting popular conservative judges confirmed. The source said there was no organized effort to back Collins financially after her confirmation vote, but that people active in the conservative legal community independently deemed her worthy of support. \"Countless Americans were inspired by Senator Collins’ principled speech in support of Justice Kavanaugh,” the source said, “so it should not be surprising to anyone that she raised more money after that, especially in light of the disgusting threats that were being made toward her and her staff at the time.” As for the donations that liberals made to a prospective campaign account for Collins’ eventual opponent, those too have been criticized as an attempt to financially incentivize the Senator’s vote; and not just by Collins’ aides. A conservative election attorney, Cleta Mitchell, told Newsmax at the time that the liberal groups may have run afoul of federal law by “trying to tie her official action to their threat that they’re going to give $1 million to somebody to run against her, if she doesn’t vote the way [they want her] to.” Ady Barkan, the progressive activist who launched the campaign, insisted it was legal and had the blessing of the Federal Elections Commission. Mitchell, a financial supporter of the Federalist Society, later gave $1,000 to Collins’ campaign, her first donation, after her vote to confirm Kavanaugh. Read more at The Daily Beast.

    "[] Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh held a press conference call with reporters on Tuesday where he said the president is “eager to return to the campaign trail and to keep campaigning and keep connecting with Americans.” The phone call came just as CNN reported that the Trump campaign had canceled plans to hold a rally in Alabama next weekend due to concerns about rising numbers of coronavirus infections. When asked about the CNN report later Tuesday afternoon, Murtaugh said, “We don’t comment about rally planning.” Murtaugh said on the call that Trump is planning to hold more of his signature rallies, and touted the president’s performance by contrasting it with his Democratic rival Joe Biden. “That is where he is, is most effective and is without question more effective than Joe Biden,” Murtaugh said of campaign rallies. “It’s no secret that Joe Biden, the Democrats and many in the national media would love to keep President Trump off the campaign trail, but he is determined to keep meeting Americans in person and speaking to them directly.” Recent polls show Trump trailing Biden by double digits both nationally and in some key states. In response, Trump has tweeted that polls showing him behind Biden are a “joke” and that his private polling shows him doing well. Questions about future campaigning arose after Trump held a rally in Tulsa, Okla., on June 20. It was the president’s first rally since early March and the largest indoor event in the country since the coronavirus lockdowns began. The rally was marked by disappointing attendance that has fueled internal tensions on the president’s campaign team. A number of staffers who were involved in setting up the event and a pair of Secret Service agents also tested positive for the virus. On the call, Murtaugh was asked if he had any specifics on where or when Trump might try to hold another event, but he declined to provide details. “As far as time, and place and actual locations of rallies, that’s something that we are always looking at and always planning and always considering,” he said, adding, “We have never had a practice of announcing a rally until it is confirmed and ready to go, so we have never commented on our deliberations.” Murtaugh’s call was mainly focused on a speech and press conference Biden held in Delaware on Tuesday afternoon. He highlighted a list of questions that the Trump campaign had wanted to hear Biden answer at the event. Murtaugh also criticized Biden for not having had a press availability in over three months and criticized the former vice president’s record, particularly on past disease outbreaks and China. Murtaugh argued that this undermined Biden’s critiques of Trump’s coronavirus response. “He has done nothing but lob partisan grenades from his basement in Delaware while facing very little scrutiny for his own record,“ Murtaugh said of Biden. _____ Read more from Yahoo News: The family of Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man killed by Colorado cops almost a year ago, is still waiting for justice New Yahoo News/YouGov coronavirus poll: Two-thirds of Americans say masks should be mandatory Spotlight on police reform raises questions about lineups and eyewitness testimony What is voter fraud?

    "[] Audrey Strauss, the prosecutor who decided to arrest Ghislaine Maxwell, acted with lightning speed just days after her predecessor was unceremoniously fired by Donald Trump. Geoffrey Berman, the outgoing US attorney for the Southern District of New York, had presided over a long inquiry which had seen him make a series of high profile public statements about the Duke of York, including that the duke was offering \"zero co-operation\". On June 20, Mr Trump ejected Mr Berman and Ms Strauss, 72, his deputy, took over his cases. Her decision to move quickly in the Jeffrey Epstein case drew plaudits from women who have accused the late financier, and questions over why the arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell had not happened sooner. Maria Farmer, who made the first criminal complaint against Epstein in 1996, wrote on Twitter: \"Strauss is doing what Berman wouldn't, his job!\" When asked about the timing of the arrest, Ms Strauss said: \"That was when we were able and prepared to move to arrest her.\" Ms Strauss took charge because Mr Trump's nominee to replace Mr Berman has to be confirmed by Congress. The nominee is Jay Clayton, chairman of Securities and Exchange Commission, but he faces opposition from Democrats. According to colleagues Ms Strauss has always been keen to stay out of the spotlight, but has a deep knowledge and experience of her department. She first served as an assistant US attorney in New York's Southern District from 1976 to 1983, prosecuting more than 20 cases, before moving into private practice. She returned as Mr Berman's deputy and has bee involved in the financial case brought against Michael Cohen, Mr Trump's former personal lawyer, and an investigation into the business dealings of his current personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Mr Giuliani has denied any wrongdoing. A former colleague of Ms Strauss said: \"I would expect that she was very much involved in all of the important cases in the office.\" Another said she would \"doggedly pursue\" investigations and was \"uniformly viewed as doing the right things for the right reasons.\" One former colleague called her a \"titan\" with a \"fantastic reputation\". Paul Shechtman, a former federal prosecutor in New York who has worked with her, told the Washington Post: \"She grew up in that office. The traditions of that office are embedded in her.\" Ms Strauss, a mother of four, is originally from Philadelphia, the daughter of Russian immigrants, and her brother worked for Nasa. She is a Democrat who has donated to Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. When he left his cases with her Mr Berman said he could do so \"in no better hands than Audrey’s.\" He said: \"She is the smartest, most principled, and effective lawyer with whom I have ever had the privilege of working.\"",
    "[] WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court agreed Thursday to consider blocking Congress' access to secret grand jury materials from the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The action was a victory for the Trump administration, which is fighting to keep a House committee controlled by Democrats from obtaining material it says could lead to another impeachment inquiry. The immediate significance is that any decision almost surely will come after the presidential election, a blow to House Democrats in pursuing a potential obstruction of justice charge against President Donald Trump in a possible second impeachment inquiry. The case likely will be heard by the high court in the fall or winter and decided in 2021. “Unfortunately, President Trump and Attorney General (William) Barr are continuing to try to run out the clock on any and all accountability,\" said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. \"While I am confident their legal arguments will fail, it is now all the more important for the American people to hold the president accountable at the ballot box in November.” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who led the House impeachment effort, said: \"The extreme lengths the Trump administration has gone to hide this material tells you all you need to know about their consciousness of guilt.” House Democrats and the Justice Department have been locked in a legal battle over grand jury testimony gathered during former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. In March, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., ruled that the House Judiciary Committee is entitled to the evidence. The committee contended that the grand jury material is \"central\" to its inquiry into possible obstruction of justice by Trump and could reveal new evidence of impeachable offenses. If so, the panel said it will consider recommending new articles of impeachment. In December, the House approved two articles of impeachment against the president. One accused Trump of abusing his power by withholding military aid in order to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into a political rival. The second accused him of obstructing Congress by stonewalling its subpoenas for documents and testimony. In February, Trump was acquitted by the Senate. But in January, House general counsel Douglas Letter told the appeals court that new impeachment articles were a possibility, pending a review of the grand jury evidence. “That is on the table; there is no doubt,” Letter told the court. The Justice Department argued that House Democrats are not entitled to grand jury evidence because they have not said which specific testimony they need or how it would help their investigation. Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote that the House has no \"urgent need of the requested materials for a hypothetical second impeachment.\" Not true, said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center, who urged the court to hear and decide the case before the election. \"Today’s decision threatens to hand President Trump a victory by default, allowing him to run out the clock on this Congress and hampering its ability to exercise its longstanding power to investigate and hold the executive branch of our government accountable to the law,\" Wydra said. At issue before the high court is a more basic legal question: Is a Senate impeachment trial a judicial proceeding? The lower court ruled that it is, saying the Framers of the Constitution understood impeachment to involve the exercise of judicial power. A separate but related House subpoena seeks testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn, a key witness on possible obstruction by Trump. The Trump administration has blocked McGahn from testifying, saying Congress can't force high-ranking presidential aides to testify. In February, a three-judge appeals court panel ruled that McGahn does not have to testify, saying the judiciary can't be an \"ombudsman\" who resolves disputes between the executive and legislative branches of government. The full appeals court reheard the case in April but has yet to rule. This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Supreme Court will decide if Democrats get Russia grand jury material",

    "[] SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — Shortly after fireworks above Mount Rushmore disappeared into the night sky on Friday, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem accompanied President Donald Trump aboard Air Force One despite having had close contact with Trump’s son’s girlfriend, who had tested positive for the coronavirus. Trump has been in a position all along to encounter a virus that spreads from people who don’t feel sick, such as Noem, who had interacted closely at a campaign fundraiser with Donald Trump Jr.'s girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, who turned out to be infected. Noem didn't wear a mask on the plane and chatted with the president as the flight returned to Washington, D.C., according to her spokesperson, Maggie Seidel. Noem had tested negative for COVID-19 shortly before welcoming Trump to South Dakota on Friday, a day after she had interacted with Guilfoyle. One photo on social media showed Noem and Guilfoyle, who is also a Trump campaign staff member, hugging. The Trump campaign announced that Guilfoyle had tested positive on Friday. Guilfoyle's infection prompted some Republicans, such as Rep. Greg Gianforte of Montana, to take precautions against the spread of the coronavirus. He suspended in-person campaigning for his gubernatorial bid after his wife and his running mate both attended a fundraiser with Guilfoyle earlier in the week. Noem doesn't plan anything similar or to get tested again for the virus, Seidel said. She cast Noem's decision to fly on Air Force One as a demonstration of how to live with the virus. Seidel pointed to comments from the World Health Organization that the spread of the virus is “rare” from asymptomatic people. But that runs counter to guidance from public health experts, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that advises people to wear masks when interacting with people outside their household. The CDC says that people with active infections can still test negative, especially if it is early in the infection. The agency recommends that even people who test negative take precautions like avoiding close contact and wearing a mask around others. Asked about Trump’s interaction with Noem, the White House noted the frequency with which the president is tested. “The president is tested constantly, has tested negative, and those around him are tested as well,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said. When asked why Noem was allowed to travel on Air Force One, McEnany referred the question to the Secret Service, but added: “They take the president’s health very seriously. They would never put him in a situation that would put him in harm’s way.” The Secret Service referred questions to the White House press office, which provided no additional comment. Ian Fury, a spokesperson for Noem, said Monday on Twitter that the governor had consulted with the White House doctor before she boarded Air Force One and was told it would be OK to fly. As the number of people hospitalized from COVID-19 in South Dakota has decreased in recent weeks to just 59 people statewide, Noem has doubled down on her relaxed approach to the pandemic. Even as Republican governors in states like Texas have moved to require people to wear masks, Noem didn't require distancing or masks at the July 3 celebration at Mount Rushmore, an outdoor event at which few in the closely packed crowd wore masks. On Friday night, she told the crowd, “Tonight, if you look to your left, if you look to your right, you're going to see that this crowd isn't just from South Dakota, but it's from everywhere across this nation.” The influx of tourists for the Rushmore fireworks has some local leaders and doctors concerned that the area could see a spike in cases. Seidel said the governor worries about other effects of the virus, such as unemployment and domestic violence. When Seidel was asked about a risk to Trump's health from Noem's presence on Air Force One, she said, “I don’t understand why Gov. Noem now needs to manage the president’s medical care.\"",
    "[] To the editor: I agree with the Editorial Board's opinion that we cannot let our guard down with this president. His disastrous mismanagement of the pandemic, flagrant disregard for those Americans who have died and now the revelation that he has allowed Russia to get away with putting a bounty on the heads of American troops in Afghanistan are all unconscionable. His aides in the White House continue to walk on eggshells around him, and the Republicans in Congress look the other way in fear of his toxic Twitter tirades and incurring the ire of the president's base. Anyone who has been paying attention knows that this desperate, mentally and morally unfit man only cares about being re-elected and will do anything to maintain his power. All indications are that he is on his way to losing this election; he is both angry and terrified. The fact that most of what he does is send out angry tweets and watch cable news proves he should be fired. Hopefully the American people will do just that on Nov. 3; until then I will faithfully wear my mask, so I can live to join them. Ramona Saenz, Alhambra .. To the editor: Thanks for the ominous warning about Trump. It's just that I keep raising the bar on my outrage level. Practically every day for the last three and a half years, Trump's done something awful. Then I say to myself, \"That's the lowest thing ever! Surely his fans will see that he's a ridiculous, lazy liar.\" But it's still getting worse. So, thanks for the warning. I won't be surprised by any dirty tricks Trump pulls. I only hope his tantrums can be corrected by the responsible adult who will replace him. Cheryl Clark, Long Beach",
    "[] A 58-year-old New Jersey man was allegedly dumping trash on a resident’s front yard for about four months because he couldn’t stand looking at a President Donald Trump flag displayed on the property, local outlets reported. Richard Keller, 58, of Franklin, was first caught in the act at about 5 a.m. on July 1 when undercover police officers witnessed Keller throw trash out of his window onto the driveway of the Sparta home, ⁠ the Sparta Police Department said, TAPintoSparta reported. It’s about a 13-minute drive from Keller’s village to the Sparta home, according to Google Maps. When one of the officers stopped Keller and asked him why he continued to dump trash on the person’s property, he responded, “I think you know...because of the flag,” police said, according to the outlet. “Some people are very passionate about their opinions,” Sparta Lt. John Lammon told TAPintoSparta. Keller could not be immediately reached for comment by McClatchy News, and did not provide comment to other media outlets. The homeowner told police the dumping started about four months ago, stopped when the coronavirus pandemic shut down the township, then began again in June, police said, the New Jersey Herald reported. After installing cameras, the homeowner said the trash was coming from a Kia Soul, and often included “full bags of garbage as well as random items like discarded grapes and a bag of flour,” according to police, the outlet said. “Mr. Keller had such disdain for President Trump that it enraged him that someone was displaying a Trump flag,” Lamon said in a press release, NJ Advance Media reported. “He decided that he would keep throwing garbage on their driveway to cause them inconvenience.” Keller was arrested July 1 and “charged with criminal mischief, harassment and several township ordinance and motor vehicle offenses,” the outlet said. Keller has since been released from police custody, NJ Advance Media reported.",
    "[] Traditional subsistence hunting has always been a pillar of life along Alaska's remote North Slope. Dependable migrations of bowhead whales, Arctic grayling fish, and the country's last remaining caribou herds have provided for generations of indigenous Alaskans who make their home on America's northernmost edge. \"We depend on a clean environment to feed our families during the year,\" Rosemary Ahtuangaruak, a 66-year-old resident of the village of Nuiqsut, told ABC News. The grandmother of twenty says she owns a harpoon and still participates in the whale hunt on Cross Island each fall. Rosemary's village is among the few largely indigenous communities scattered throughout the region's vast Arctic oil fields. A small grid of homes located at the limits of most modern transportation routes with just one grocery store, more than three-quarters of the Inupiat Eskimo village relies on traditional subsistence hunting as their primary source of food. With the arrival of COVID-19, residents of Nuiqsut say it's been decades since their ancestral ways have been this important. The global pandemic forced roads to close and the region's only airline to declare bankruptcy, cutting off an already isolated village from outside supply lines. With the nearest hospital hundreds of miles away and the virus pushing northward, some fear the village -- with a population of just 500 -- would be wiped off the map if community spread took hold. \"It's life or death,\" Siqiniq Maupin, a community advocate based in Fairbanks whose family lives in Nuiqsut, told ABC News. \"We have people that need to hunt and be out on the land right now because we just don't know what's going to happen this winter.\" But in the midst of the crisis, as the tribal government frantically moved to obtain medical supplies and shut down non-essential services, residents learned their community was being asked to confront yet another challenge -- the federal government's controversial plan to massively expand oil and gas drilling in the area. MORE: Fear and fishing: Tiny Alaskan village tries to manage influx of commercial fishermen amid COVID-19 In April, the Bureau of Land Management -- the agency within the United States Department of the Interior responsible for the administration of public lands -- moved forward with \"virtual public comment hearings\" on revised plans for the controversial ConocoPhillips Willow Oil Project. The Willow project aims to add a gravel mine and up to 250 oil and gas wells to the existing energy extraction sites already surrounding Nuiqsut on nearly all sides. First proposed in 2018, the project has long been opposed by some tribal leaders and environmental groups for its potential impacts on wildlife and public health. \"It's a massive project that threatens wildlife, exacerbates climate change and impacts indigenous culture and food security,\" Adam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, told ABC News. \"We were concerned before the pandemic but to see the Bureau of Land Management continue to kind of move at warp speed during the pandemic … makes no sense at all.\" ConocoPhillips' declined to be interviewed for this report, but a company spokesman denied the project would impact subsistence hunting or public health in a statement to ABC News. \"The Willow project will be one of the first North Slope projects designed and built-in compliance with new EPA rules that reduce emissions and minimize environmental impacts,\" the spokesperson wrote. The Willow development's virtual hearings -- conducted via Zoom -- were the culmination of a contentious public comment period for the project's revised environmental review that commenced on March 20, just a week after President Donald Trump declared COVID-19 to be a national emergency and four days after he advised all Americans to avoid gatherings of 10 or more people. The release of the Willow project's new environmental review would typically result in more in-person meetings within the village to ensure public awareness and input regarding the proposed changes, but the Bureau of Land Management relied on teleconferencing for the remote indigenous community, ignoring repeated requests from the tribal government, congressional leaders, and environmental groups to suspend the process in light of the region's lack of internet access and the pandemic's impact on public participation. \"They kept getting cut off, losing reception, words weren't being heard,\" Martha Itta, a lifetime resident and tribal administrator for the village who called into the hearings, told ABC News. \"It was a really poor process.\" Despite the technical challenges and emotional pleas from village members for an extension, the Bureau of Land Management closed the public comment period on May 4, effectively cutting off organized public input as the agency finalizes its plan for the project en route to getting final approval. The agency is still accepting comments via mail and the Bureau of Land Management website. Alaska Bureau of Land Management officials defended the virtual hearings and emphasized the importance of maintaining \"a capable and functioning government,\" in an email to ABC News, saying that the agency was using technology to both protect its employees and \"ensure connection and service to the public.\" \"These virtual meetings are providing more people with access to participate and have their voices heard,\" Alaska Bureau of Land Management officials wrote in a statement to ABC News, saying the virtual meetings drew approximately 50 more people than in-person meetings conducted earlier in the review process. MORE: 'Into the Wild' bus airlifted out of Alaskan wilderness due to concerns over tourist safety \"Public input is fundamental and of the highest importance to the Bureau,\" the spokesperson wrote. But some Nuiqsut residents say the agency's rush to expand oil operations during a pandemic deliberately ignored their concerns. Just last month, the agency followed up the Willow project's virtual hearings with a massive plan to offer oil companies 18.6 million more acres of public lands across Alaska's Northwest, including previously protected wildlife areas such as Teshekpuk Lake, a vital subsistence hunting location for indigenous villages including Nuiqsut, where caribou herds, polar bears, and millions of migratory birds can be found. \"The [oil development] process is sacrificing our village,\" Ahtuangaruak told ABC News. \"It shouldn't be forced down our throats when we are not effectively able to participate.\" The Willow project is one of several plans the federal government is currently advancing that could turn over vast swaths of America's landscapes to oil and gas interests while the public's attention is focused on the ongoing pandemic and civil unrest. Since President Trump's March 13 national emergency declaration, the Bureau of Land Management has leased more than 100,000 acres of public lands to fossil fuel companies across the country and pushed an array of extraction-friendly proposals that could impact iconic areas ranging from the Alaskan Arctic to the American Southwest. Public lands surrounding Arches National Park, Canyonlands National Park, Bears Ears National Monument, Chaco Canyon National Historic Park and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are just some of the treasured American landscapes that would see oil, gas, and mineral development under the various proposals currently underway. \"People are hurting around the country,\" Bob Deans of the Natural Resources Defense Fund told ABC News. \"And unfortunately, the administration chooses this opportunity to wage a multi-fronted assault on the environment and public health.\" The controversial moves have garnered little attention outside of directly affected communities and have some critics claiming the administration is using the cover of a global pandemic to advance oil and gas interests on public lands. \"The administration is hoping we'll be too distracted to understand what's at stake,\" Deans said. \"This is short-term profits for big polluters and leaves the rest of us to pay the price.\" The Trump administration's drive to drill public lands for fossil fuels is perhaps most apparent in Alaska. There, on the country's last great frontier, the Bureau of Land Management has not only gone forward with controversial virtual public comment hearings for the ConocoPhillips' Willow Project, but it is promising a historic increase in oil and gas development across the state's public lands in the months to come -- despite the global oil glut underway. MORE: Russian bombers intercepted 8 miles from US airspace In addition to the Willow Project's central processing facility and infrastructure pad, access and infield roads, pipelines, a gravel mine, an airstrip, and up 250 new wells, the agency is also proposing the construction of an entirely separate 20-foot-high, 211-mile-long gravel road intended solely for industrial copper mining in the region. Meanwhile, top officials at the Bureau of Land Management and Department of the Interior have also recently doubled down on their vow to conduct oil and gas lease sales inside the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge before the year's end. The move would be an unprecedented step toward opening America's largest wilderness area to oil and gas development. In addition to transforming some of Alaska's most iconic landscapes and exacerbating climate change in the already melting Arctic, critics argue the new developments threaten to cut indigenous villages off from one of their most important food sources: migrating caribou herds. \"It's just so overwhelming right now,\" Maupin said. \"We have so many projects happening at the same time over such a large state that we can't attend every single hearing.\" Bureau of Land Management and Department of the Interior leadership declined to be interviewed for this story. William Perry Pendley, the Bureau of Land Management's temporary head, has stated in the past that \"it is crucial that we fulfill our statutory and regulatory responsibilities during this difficult time to provide for our future economic stability when Americans do return to work.\" But according to former California State Bureau of Land Management Director Jim McKenna, a 40-year agency veteran, the Bureau of Land Management appears to be ignoring the conservation aspect of its mission. \"Oil and gas leasing now in the midst of a pandemic oil glut makes no sense,\" McKenna told ABC News. \"It flies in the face of public interest.\" According to McKenna, the flood of agency activity during the pandemic shows the current leadership's \"very cavalier attitude towards the public.\" \"People who are the most directly affected are being shuffled aside,\" he said. \"And that to me is wrong.\" Pendley, the agency's temporary head, spent much of his career as an attorney representing oil and gas interests in public land disputes, arguing that the federal government should transfer or sell most of its public lands to states. In May, conservation groups filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration for extending Pendley's tenure for the fifth time without Senate approval. Late last month, the White House said it intends to officially nominate Pendley to lead the Bureau of Land Management. According to McKenna, many of his former colleagues are \"dispirited\" at the direction the agency has taken and \"don't feel like they can say things that are true out loud.\" \"This isn't the agency that I grew up in,\" McKenna said. Historically, oil and gas development has brought monetary wealth to some indigenous Alaskans, particularly those with shares in Alaskan Native Corporations who receive regular payments from developers -- but critics say that with the added resources also came pollution, health risks and a noted impact on the land and waters local populations have depended on for centuries. Perhaps no village embodies this contrast better than Nuiqsut, which sits directly beside the National Petroleum Reserve and has seen an explosion of oil and gas development over the past several decades. \"When I came to Nuiqsut, the lights were 20 miles away,\" Ahtuangaruak said in reference to the oil and gas facilities. \"Now I have lights to the east of us from development at Prudhoe Bay, to the north of us from the offshore development in the Beaufort Sea, to the west of us from the National Petroleum Reserve, and now to the south of us from the new developments.\" As Alaska's largest oil producer with most of its key operations in the North Slope, ConocoPhillips' presence is hard to miss in the region. In addition to its ubiquitous processing and extraction facilities surrounding Nuiqsut -- where children can see active drill pads from their school steps -- the oil company sponsors educational events such as the village's health fair and science symposium, as well as a nearby playground. The company is also a major political force, spending nearly $5 million dollars on national political lobbying in 2019, and it is among the top five donors to Alaskan Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski -- giving nearly $40,000 to her campaigns over the past five years as the company grew its holdings in the state. During her career as a community health aide from 1986-2000, Ahtuangaruak said, she started noticing more respiratory illnesses in her village as development grew around it. She is among many in the village who believe the oil and gas infrastructure has compromised their health. \"[When] I stopped working at the clinic, there were 70 [respiratory illness cases] -- but when I started, there was just one,\" she said. \"There were nights I was up all night helping people breathe.\" In response to the community's widespread concerns about air pollution, the state of Alaska conducted multiple assessments of the area's air quality and found that pollutant concentrations were \"generally well below the national ambient air quality standards,\" blaming any potential rise in respiratory problems on seasonal flus, poor indoor air quality, diesel auto-emissions, and high smoking rates. However, ConocoPhillips owns the only air monitoring instruments in the area, leading many residents to doubt the government's findings. The instruments are operated by a consulting company and its reports are prepared for ConocoPhillips before being sent to government and tribal agencies as well as audited quarterly by another independent party. Yet ConocoPhillips' multiple oil and wastewater spills in the region, including in 2009 and 2017 -- along with one of the company's subsidiaries pleading guilty to failing to maintain proper records of an oil spill and attempting to hide a spill in 2004 -- have only added to the community's sense of distrust. \"ConocoPhillips has consistently proven that we can safely, responsibly, and sustainably operate on Alaska's North Slope,\" a company spokesman wrote to ABC News. \"The 2004 incident you are referring to was a records-keeping violation following a deck spill during a routine maintenance operation,\" the spokesman wrote. ConocoPhillips's subsidiary, Polar Tankers, \"immediately terminated the ship's captain\" and agreed to pay a $500,000 fine and a $2 million community-service payment to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. MORE: Russian bombers intercepted 8 miles from US airspace \"Polar Tankers resolved the matter with the authorities, and subsequently has been recognized by state and federal programs for its health, safety and the environment performance. However, this has no connection to our North Slope operations,\" the spokesman said. This coming winter was expected to be a major production year for ConocoPhillips in Alaska, but the oil glut caused by the pandemic forced the company to scale back its ambitions in the Arctic. The Bureau of Land Management's virtual hearing announcement for the Willow project came two days after ConocoPhillips announced it was cutting roughly $200 million from its Alaska budget -- mainly by slowing production in the North Slope. \"Significant public comment on Willow development occurred well before the COVID pandemic,\" the ConocoPhillips' spokesperson wrote. \"We are supportive of the BLM's efforts to continue permitting projects on a timely basis.\" At the time of the announcement, Pendley, the Bureau of Land Management head, said the move to go forward with the virtual hearings was \"in the spirit of service to the public,\" while Bureau of Land Management Alaska officials said the hearings actually increased public participation. \"It's completely insulting,\" Maupin, the community advocate, told ABC News, saying that if there was any increase in participation it was \"because people are crying, asking you not to inhumanely hold these processes during a pandemic.\" \"This entire process was a joke, and it's really sad that so many people had to endure that,\" she said. \"We always say they don't give a damn about us -- it's really heartbreaking,\" Nuiqsut resident Martha Itta said. After the hearings, Itta wrote a scathing letter to the Bureau of Land Management describing her experiences and demanding the process be halted. Despite the recent setbacks, Rosemary Ahtuangaruak has vowed to continue her opposition to the Bureau of Land Management's plans for her village -- but she's concerned that few outside her community are paying close enough attention. \"We need our nation to respond,\" Ahtuangaruak told ABC News. \"Otherwise, they are going to push forward to protect profitability at all costs. Stand up and protect the life, health and safety of people who are living nearby and protect this beautiful area for generations to come.\" Alaska at center of Trump administration’s drive to drill public lands during pandemic originally appeared on abcnews.go.com",
    "[] When the Supreme Court voted 5-4 in June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo to strike down a Louisiana law requiring abortionists to have hospital-admitting privileges, it dealt a blow to the pro-life movement. However, while disappointing, “this was not a decision that sends us packing our bags,” said Louisiana Right to Life executive director Benjamin Clapper. In Clapper’s view, the decision actually gained lost ground for the pro-life movement, as Chief Justice John Roberts’ concurrence, which controls as precedent for the lower courts, eviscerated the balancing standard established by Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, a case involving a similar admitting-privileges law in Texas. “The chief justice returned us to the Planned Parenthood v. Casey standard, where it’s the question of whether there’s a substantial obstacle to the undue-burden test,” he said. Clapper’s hope is strengthened by the Court’s decision to vacate and remand the case of Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. last week, involving an Indiana ultrasound and parental-consent law that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had struck down as unconstitutional using the Hellerstedt decision. The Indiana law is “breaking ground that Casey didn’t even address with parental consent,” Clapper said. “So, that’s certainly a hopeful new day that really, we believe, brings us back to pre-2016,” when Hellerstedt was decided. In his concurrence, Roberts wrote that while he believed Hellerstedt, a case in which he dissented, had been wrongly decided, the Court was bound by precedent to strike down the Louisiana law. While the chief justice has historically taken an incremental approach to chipping away at wrongly decided precedents, Chelsey Youman, Human Coalition’s Texas state director and national legislative consultant, said “we would argue that when a precedent is wrongly decided and you have the chance every five, maybe ten years to correctly decide that case, that’s what should be done.” Senator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) called the decision “plain terrible jurisprudence” in a statement to National Review. “SCOTUS got this decision wrong by yet again trying to do footsie-politics. If the Court cares about preserving its legitimacy as a non-political institution, it shouldn’t make decisions based on how its judgments will be perceived politically,” the pro-life senator said. Roberts has proven a wild card, siding with the liberal justices in the June Medical decision and in blocking the Trump administration’s attempt to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, as well as in a case that prohibited employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. “I think [the decision] is awful for conservative jurisprudence and I think for every pro-life American, Roberts is out,” said 40 Days for Life co-founder, CEO, and president Shawn Carney. “He’s absolutely useless. It’s not that he’s a disappointment, it’s that no one respects him and this decision confirmed that.” Roberts’ wavering loyalties have underscored the importance of both the vetting process in Supreme Court nominations and the upcoming 2020 presidential election. “It’s important for (potential nominees) to have had drafted opinions on these issues and have published opinions on these issues so that we understand exactly where they stand when ultimately appointed,” Youman said of the vetting process. President Trump “does an incredible job” of vetting justices, she added, a sentiment echoed by many in the pro-life movement who are pleased that President Trump’s justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, have held to a conservative viewpoint in June Medical and other cases. One or two more seats in the next four years would be exactly what the movement needs to “really ensure that Roe v. Wade is ultimately overturned,” she said. March for Life president Jeanne Mancini stressed the importance of reelecting President Trump in November, as well as electing pro-life legislators, saying “this is the single most important election when it comes to pro-life issues.” “For pro-lifers who know that culture is upstream of policy and that our biggest goals are to change hearts and minds and to create a culture where abortion is unthinkable, we also know that legislation and laws prescribe to people what is ethical and they influence culture,” Mancini said. According to a May 2020 Gallup poll, 24 percent of registered voters said a candidate must share their views on abortion, while 50 percent said abortion was one of many important factors and 25 percent of respondents said it was not a major issue. “The onus is really on Congress to take back Roe v. Wade,” Youman said. “The responsibility falls squarely on our legislators’ shoulders, that’s why it’s so important to vote for our legislators on this issue specifically because we don’t have to wait a lifetime — it’s been 47 years since Roe v. Wade was decided — to overcome it, we can simply pass the right legislation.” In the meantime, the movement has other cause for optimism: abortion rates are at an all-time low, pro-life support is high — 47 percent of Americans say abortion is morally wrong and 9 percent say morality depends on the situation — and only 587 Planned Parenthood clinics remain open, down from a peak of 938 in the mid 90s. “I think it’s hard to see sometimes the moment you’re in,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List. “We are in the arc of history on abortion in the pro-life movement and very close to what is a beautiful story within some really difficult stories about the direction of the country.” The June Medical Decision Was Not a Win for Women’s Health Care Pro-Life and Pro-Choice Demonstrators Meet outside the Supreme Court For the Love of Roe",
    "[] By Jennifer Hiller HOUSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Supreme Court decision recognizing about half of Oklahoma as Native American reservation land has implications for oil and gas development in the state, raising complex regulatory and tax questions that could take years to settle, according to Oklahoma attorneys. The court on Thursday overturned an Oklahoma tribe member’s rape conviction because the location where the crime was committed should have been considered reservation land and therefore outside the reach of state criminal law. The decision does not affect property ownership, but attorneys said it has regulatory and tax implications within reservation lands of the state's \"Five Tribes\" - Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole. Oklahoma was the fourth-largest U.S. crude oil producer last year, accounting for about 5% of production, according to government data. \"You’ll see the Five Tribes make arguments perhaps that they have taxation authority,” said Taiawagi Helton, who teaches environmental, property and Indian law at the University of Oklahoma. \"It’s possible you could see some slight increases in taxation,\" with companies paying production taxes to both the state and tribes. \"For pipeline approvals, tribes will expect to have a broader consultative role,\" Helton said. Tribes may not want to immediately act, but this case suggests they would have regulatory authority over oil and gas, said Oklahoma energy attorney A.J. Ferate. \"Do I suspect anybody is going to get their existing production taken away? I think that would be a very extreme issue,\" Ferate said. \"We’re talking about decades of litigation and questions. We’re in a whole new world here in Oklahoma as to how do all of these pieces fit together and how do we move forward,\" he said. Mike McBride III, chair of Indian law at Tulsa law firm Crowe and Dunlevy, said there may be implications for wind energy and electric transmission as well as sales of water. Industry group the Petroleum Alliance of Oklahoma said it hoped there would be no change from current regulation. \"It is critical for continued investment in Oklahoma that the state maintain primacy with regard to the regulation of oil and gas operations, and that issues of title with regard to real property remain unaffected,” it said in a statement. The Petroleum Alliance and other business groups had opposed the recognition of reservation status in a brief to the Supreme Court arguing that it would \"recast the business and legal environment\" across lands of all Five Tribes. The Five Tribes and the state issued a joint statement on Thursday that they were working together on a framework of shared jurisdiction to \"support public safety, our economy and private property rights.\"  (Reporting by Jennifer Hiller in Houston and Valerie Volcovici in Washington, D.C.; Editing by Marguerita Choy)",

    "[] WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Monday demanded more information about President Donald Trump's decision to commute the prison sentence of longtime ally Roger Stone. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson ordered that the parties provide her by Tuesday with a copy of the executive order that commuted Stone's sentence. She also asked for clarity about the scope of the clemency, including whether it covers just his prison sentence or also the two-year period of supervised release that was part of his sentence. Hours after the judge's directive, the Justice Department submitted to the court a two-page order making clear that the clemency extended to both Stone's prison sentence and his supervised release. In the order, also posted on the website of the Justice Department's pardon attorney office, Trump wrote that justice would not be served were Stone “to remain confined to his home or serve the said sentence, and the safety of the community will not be compromised if he is released from home confinement and clemency is granted.” Trump commuted Stone's 40-month prison sentence on Friday evening, just days before he was to report to prison. Stone was convicted as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation of making false statements, tampering with a witness and obstructing lawmakers who were examining Russian interference in the 2016 election. The president told reporters on Monday that he was getting “rave reviews” for his action on Stone and restated his position that the Russia investigation “should have never taken place.\" Democrats lambasted Trump’s action on behalf of Stone as having undermined the rule of law, and Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the only Republican to vote to convict the president during his impeachment trial, called the clemency decision “unprecedented, historic corruption.” Mueller himself defended the Stone prosecution in a Washington Post opinion piece in which he said Stone “remains a convicted felon, and rightly so.” In an interview Monday evening on Fox News, Stone, 67, described the criminal investigation and prosecution as the “most horrible experience you can have.\" Stone said that while he knew Trump might “take some shots\" for the commutation, “I think most people, most fair-minded people, understand he saved my life and, at least on paper, he gave me a chance to fight for vindication.” Although presidents have broad authority to commute prison sentences and issue pardons, the brief order from Jackson — who presided over Stone's trial last year — made clear that the judge nonetheless sought additional information and clarity about the clemency, including the actual executive order from the White House.

    "[] The Central Intelligence Agency has conducted a series of covert cyber operations against Iran and other targets since winning a secret victory in 2018 when President Trump signed what amounts to a sweeping authorization for such activities, according to former U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the matter. The secret authorization, known as a presidential finding, gives the spy agency more freedom in both the kinds of operations it conducts and who it targets, undoing many restrictions that had been in place under prior administrations. The finding allows the CIA to more easily authorize its own covert cyber operations, rather than requiring the agency to get approval from the White House. Unlike previous presidential findings that have focused on a specific foreign policy objective or outcome — such as preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear power — this directive, driven by the National Security Council and crafted by the CIA, focuses more broadly on a capability: covert action in cyberspace. The “very aggressive” finding “gave the agency very specific authorities to really take the fight offensively to a handful of adversarial countries,” said a former U.S. government official. These countries include Russia, China, Iran and North Korea — which are mentioned directly in the document — but the finding potentially applies to others as well, according to another former official. “The White House wanted a vehicle to strike back,” said the second former official. “And this was the way to do it.” The CIA’s new powers are not about hacking to collect intelligence. Instead, they open the way for the agency to launch offensive cyber operations with the aim of producing disruption — like cutting off electricity or compromising an intelligence operation by dumping documents online — as well as destruction, similar to the U.S.-Israeli 2009 Stuxnet attack, which destroyed centrifuges that Iran used to enrich uranium gas for its nuclear program. The finding has made it easier for the CIA to damage adversaries’ critical infrastructure, such as petrochemical plants, and to engage in the kind of hack-and-dump operations that Russian hackers and WikiLeaks popularized, in which tranches of stolen documents or data are leaked to journalists or posted on the internet. It has also freed the agency to conduct disruptive operations against organizations that were largely off limits previously, such as banks and other financial institutions. Another key change with the finding is it lessened the evidentiary requirements that limited the CIA’s ability to conduct covert cyber operations against entities like media organizations, charities, religious institutions or businesses believed to be working on behalf of adversaries’ foreign intelligence services, as well as individuals affiliated with these organizations, according to former officials. “Before, you would need years of signals and dozens of pages of intelligence to show that this thing is a de facto arm of the government,” a former official told Yahoo News. Now, “as long as you can show that it vaguely looks like the charity is working on behalf of that government, then you’re good.” The CIA has wasted no time in exercising the new freedoms won under Trump. Since the finding was signed two years ago, the agency has carried out at least a dozen operations that were on its wish list, according to this former official. “This has been a combination of destructive things — stuff is on fire and exploding — and also public dissemination of data: leaking or things that look like leaking.” Some CIA officials greeted the new finding as a needed reform that allows the agency to act more nimbly. “People were doing backflips in the hallways [when it was signed],” said another former U.S. official. But critics, including some former U.S. officials, see a potentially dangerous attenuation of intelligence oversight, which could have unintended consequences and even put people’s lives at risk, according to former officials. The involvement of U.S. intelligence agencies in hack-and-dump activities also raises uncomfortable comparisons for some former officials. “Our government is basically turning into f****ing WikiLeaks, [using] secure communications on the dark web with dissidents, hacking and dumping,” said one such former official. The CIA declined to comment or respond to an extensive list of questions from Yahoo News. The National Security Council did not respond to multiple written requests for comment. While the CIA has been pushing for years to expand its cyber authorities, Russia’s interference in the 2016 election led Obama officials to grasp for new ways to retaliate against the Kremlin. High-level discussions included proposals for the CIA to dump embarrassing hacked information about Russian officials online, as well as to destroy Russian servers, according to former officials. But just days away from launching operations in the late summer of 2016, intelligence operatives were told to stand down, according to former officials. The decision to do so was made at the highest levels of the Obama administration, according to a former senior national security official. During the early days of the Trump administration, intelligence officials were hopeful that the president would give the go-ahead to those operations. But senior Trump officials weren’t interested in retaliating against Russia for the election interference, according to a former official. “It was radio silence,” the former official said. “It all dissipated, went to nothing.” While plans for immediate cyber retaliation against Russia faded, discussions about expanding the CIA’s cyber authorities continued to accelerate under Trump. For years, the CIA had bristled under what some intelligence officials considered onerous barriers to covert action in cyberspace that prevented it from even proposing many operations, according to former officials. When it came to covert action, “you always had the two camps [inside the CIA],” said Robert Eatinger, who served at the CIA for 24 years, including a stint as the agency’s top lawyer. There were “those who felt that their hands were too tied, and those who felt the restrictions were wise and appropriate,” recalled Eatinger, who said he has no knowledge of the CIA cyber finding signed by Trump and wouldn’t discuss specific incidents that occurred during his time with the agency. Advocates for greater cyber authorities gained the upper hand in these debates under the Trump administration, which encouraged the CIA to stretch its prior authorities to pursue more aggressive offensive cyber operations — particularly against Iran. “Trump wanted to push decision making to the lowest possible denominator,” said a former intelligence official. Mike Pompeo made that point clear after Trump made him CIA director in January 2017. Pompeo’s message, the former official said, was: “We don’t want to hold you up, we want to move, move, move.” A current senior intelligence official, who declined to discuss specific U.S. government operations or policies, called Trump-era interest in offensive operations “phenomenal.” The CIA, the National Security Agency and the Pentagon “have been able to play like we should be playing in the last couple years,” the current official said. John Bolton’s appointment as national security adviser in April 2018 gave another boost to those seeking to ease restrictions on cyber operations. “We needed to scrap the Obama-era rules and replace them with a more agile, expeditious decision-making structure,” Bolton writes in his recently published memoir, “The Room Where It Happened.” Part of this involved strengthening the U.S. government’s “clandestine capabilities” in cyberspace against “nonstate actors” and others, he writes. In September 2018, Bolton announced that Trump had signed a presidential directive easing Obama-era rules governing military cyber operations. Although the administration disclosed the existence of that directive — known as National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 — the underlying rules of engagement for military cyber operations remain secret. The administration also kept secret the CIA finding, which gave the agency its new authorities. The CIA’s new cyber powers prompted concerns among some officials. “Trump came in and way overcorrected,” said a former official. Covert cyber operations that in the past would have been rigorously vetted through the NSC, with sometimes years-long gaps between formulation and execution, now go “from idea to approval in weeks,” said the former official. Former officials declined to speak in detail about cyber operations the CIA has carried out as a result of the finding, but they said the agency has already conducted covert hack-and-dump actions aimed at both Iran and Russia. For example, the CIA has dumped information online about an ostensibly independent Russian company that was “doing work for Russian intelligence services,” said a former official. While the former official declined to be more specific, BBC Russia reported in July 2019 that hackers had breached the network of SyTech, a company that does work for the FSB, Russia’s domestic spy agency, and stolen about 7.5 terabytes of data; the data from that hack was passed to media organizations. In another stunning hack-and-dump operation, an unknown group in March 2019 posted on the internet chat platform Telegram the names, addresses, phone numbers and photos of Iranian intelligence officers allegedly involved in hacking operations, as well as hacking tools used by Iranian intelligence operatives. That November, the details of 15 million debit cards for customers of three Iranian banks linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were also dumped on Telegram. Although sources wouldn’t say if the CIA was behind those Iran breaches, the finding’s expansion of CIA authorities to target financial institutions, such as an operation to leak bank card data, represents a significant escalation in U.S. cyber operations. Under prior administrations, senior Treasury Department officials argued successfully against leaking or wiping out banking data, according to former officials, because it could destabilize the global financial system. These were operations the “CIA always knew were an option, but were always a bridge too far,\" said a former official. “They had been bandied about at senior levels for a long time, but cooler heads had always prevailed.\" The new cyber finding further emboldened the CIA’s operations against Iran, according to former officials. Even before Trump signed the directive, administration officials were already encouraging the CIA to aggressively interpret preexisting secret Iran-related authorities to help prosecute the administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran. Using the Cold War strategy of rolling back the Soviet Union as inspiration, senior Trump national security officials believed that destabilizing Iran within its borders would force the regime to cease its adventurism abroad and, perhaps, collapse. The maximum-pressure campaign includes punishing economic sanctions, but has also involved CIA cyberattacks on Iranian infrastructure, said former officials. “It was obvious that destabilization was the plan on Iran,” said one former official, and Trump administration officials were eager to have the CIA conduct destructive cyber operations against targets inside that country. Bolton “wanted another tool, he wanted another hammer. He was looking at Stuxnet and how to be mean to Iran, so that was probably attractive to him,” said another source. The Trump administration was able to lean on extensive legal powers for covert action against the Islamic Republic that were already on the books, including a presidential finding dating back at least to the early 2000s devoted to counterproliferation — in other words, preventing a nuclear-armed Iran, according to former officials. Another long-standing Iran-focused presidential finding authorizes the CIA to counter Tehran’s influence in the Middle East, in particular by combating Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and by supporting groups in the region opposed to the regime, according to former U.S. officials. Neither these two Iran-related findings, nor the new cyber finding, mention regime change as a stated goal, according to former officials. Over time, however, the CIA and other national security officials have interpreted the first two Iran findings increasingly broadly, with covert activities evolving from their narrow focus on stopping Tehran’s nuclear program, they said. The Iran findings have been subject to “classic mission creep,” said one former official. Fatigue from having to continually beat back Iran’s nuclear progress gradually led U.S. officials to take an even more aggressive approach that began to resemble a regime change strategy, according to former officials. The thinking became “If we can impact the regime, then no bomb,” said another former official. “We’re playing semantics — destabilization is functionally the same thing as regime change. It’s a deniability issue,” the former official said. While the CIA’s new powers expand the agency’s ability to target Iran and other foreign adversaries, they also present potential pitfalls, according to former officials. The CIA and the Pentagon have long tussled over authorities in cyberspace, and these coordination issues will only become more critical now, according to former officials — especially when U.S. military operatives online unknowingly run up against their counterparts from the CIA. “If you’re doing something on someone’s network and you have friendly forces also on the network, you don’t want to have fratricide,” said a former senior military intelligence official. Even inside the U.S. intelligence community, the CIA has a reputation for secrecy, according to former officials. The CIA’s “deconfliction is poor, they’re not keeping people in the loop on what their cyber operations are,” said another former official. Some former officials even worry about the oversight of cyber operations within the CIA. Agency cyber operatives “weren’t always transparent” about their activities, said a former senior official. “It was a problem. There were times I was surprised.” This more permissive environment may also intensify concerns about the CIA’s ability to secure its hacking arsenal. In 2017, WikiLeaks published a large cache of CIA hacking tools known as “Vault 7.” The leak, which a partially declassified CIA assessment called “the largest data loss in CIA history,” was made possible by “woefully lax” security practices at the CIA’s top hacker unit, the assessment said. Eatinger, the former top CIA attorney, who retired in 2015, said it’s unclear to him whether the new cyber finding would be a return to the agency’s more freewheeling days of the 1980s, or something that goes even further. Either way, it’s a “big deal,” he said. Removing NSC oversight of covert operations is a significant departure from recent history, according to Eatinger. “I would look at the intel community as the same as the military in that there should be civilian control of big decisions — who to go to war against, who to launch an attack against, who to fight a particular battle,” he said. “It makes sense that you would have that kind of civilian or non-intelligence civilian leadership for activities as sensitive as covert action.” Regardless, these expansive new cyber powers may become a lasting legacy of the Trump administration, solidifying the greater role the CIA has long coveted in a key arena, and providing the agency with authorities it has desired for three presidential administrations. “People thought, ‘Hey, George W. Bush will sign this,’ but he didn’t,” said a former official. CIA officials then believed, “‘Obama will sign it.’ Then he didn’t.” “Then Trump came in, and CIA thought he wouldn’t sign,” recalled this official. “But he did.” _____ Read more from Yahoo News: After a Black protester is killed in Omaha, witnesses claim a rushed investigation ignored signs of the shooter's allegedly racist past After months of being silenced, CDC is easing back into public view Yahoo News/YouGov July 4 poll: A staggering 62 percent of Americans no longer see America as Ronald Reagan's 'shining city on a hill' What is voter fraud?

    "[] Donald Trump's presidency is a roller coaster everywhere except in his approval rating. There have been ups (the economy, the killing of an ISIS leader) and there have been downs (the Mueller investigation and impeachment inquiry, to start) in his presidency. Through it all, though, the president's job approval has remained steady across all polls, the NBC News/Wall Street Journal’s included. Trump's approval rating has hovered within the same nine-point range (upper: 47 percent in the Oct. 14-17, 2018 and February 14-17, 2020, polls; lower: 38 percent in Oct. 23-26, 2017) since his inauguration in January 2017. The chart below shows Trump's approval rating history, along with those of Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton when they were president. It will be updated when new polls are published.

    "[] It’s an understatement, to say the least, that Trump has been isolating some of his military fan base lately. It looks like he’s done a lot of lip service in praise of vets recently, from photo-ops at the Walter Reed Military Hospital, to attending a wreath-laying ceremony at the Korean War Memorial, all while it’s come to light that Trump may have known about Russia allegedly offering bounties on American soldiers in Afghanistan in 2019. Now, NPR has reported that Trump is choosing for-profit colleges over supporting vets who were defrauded and misled by those schools. The Department of Veteran Affairs will be allowing for-profit schools, like the University of Phoenix, to access GI Bill money, even though the school—which is the largest recipient of GI Bill funds—previously had to cough up almost $200 million for making misleading claims to students about career placement. As The New York Times reported, Trump also vetoed a resolution in May that ultimately makes it much more difficult for vets to successfully seek loan forgiveness. But why one might ask, are GI Bill funds so crucial to for-profit colleges? Well, it’s because they allow the schools to exploit a legal loophole. As NPR explains, the schools are required to receive 10% or more of their funding outside of federal aid, and GI Bill funds don’t count towards the 90% cap on governmental aid. “We always say in the military that you leave no soldier behind and I definitely feel left behind, by my president, by my government,” Tasha Berkhalter, who lost all her GI money by enrolling at the now-defunct ITT Tech in Indiana, told NPR.

    "[] Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore wants to concentrate the power to fire officers in his own hands, saying the board that reviews his disciplinary decisions is overly lenient. Bypassing the Board of Rights would require changing the city charter and would essentially undo a major reworking of police discipline that was approved by L.A. voters three years ago. At a meeting Thursday with The Times editorial board that focused on police reforms in the wake of the George Floyd killing, Moore said the current system \"always seems to default in favor of the officer.\" When Moore recommends that an officer be fired, whether for a fatal shooting or for driving drunk off-duty or some other misconduct, the case goes to a three-member Board of Rights. The police chief can downgrade the discipline recommended by the board but cannot increase it. Moore pointed to other police agencies where the chief can quickly fire an officer and the decision is final unless overturned by a city manager or a court. \"I recently referred an officer who was out of policy in a shooting to a Board of Rights, and that officer is found not guilty,\" he said. \"And that, you know, pre-empts me, and that was the only means in which I can remove that officer. And so that is, in my view, terrible.\" Craig Lally, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union that represents rank-and-file LAPD officers, said the Board of Rights system is working well and that checks on the chief's power are needed. \"Every chief wants the power to do whatever they want, but officers are afforded due process,\" Lally said. \"Most people out there think due process is the fair thing to do. It's not that the chief gets to have an investigation, and then the officer is terminated.\" Despite the Board of Rights, Moore has still been able to fire a number of officers, Lally said. Moore told the editorial board that he fired 18 officers last year. Prior to the passage of Charter Amendment C in May 2017, Board of Rights panels were made up of one civilian and two members of the LAPD command staff. The amendment, which was supported by Mayor Eric Garcetti and the City Council, gave officers the option of an all-civilian panel. The LAPPL spent at least $839,000 to campaign for its passage. Perhaps counterintuitively, civilians are generally considered more sympathetic to police officers than their commanders. Some groups that favor greater police accountability, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles, opposed the amendment, saying it was deceptive and developed behind closed doors. Melanie Ochoa, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Southern California, said Thursday that it is important to have checks on a chief's power to fire officers. Police chiefs should not be able to abuse their power by firing whistleblowers or targeting racial minorities, Ochoa said. But she agrees with Moore that the Board of Rights is too lax on problem officers. \"The way the Board of Rights has operated is not just to protect against nefarious aims,\" Ochoa said. \"It has operated to eliminate accountability altogether.\" Moore said he has been speaking with Garcetti about his proposal and how to bring it about. A spokesman from Garcetti's office did not respond to a request for comment. Moore said he also wants to seize a moment when policing is being reimagined to change the state law that prevents him from speaking about individual disciplinary cases. \"I think the public should have a clear view of when I call balls balls and when I call strikes strikes, the actions I take, and I should be able to speak freely about it, in defense of why I think that that decision was right,\" he told the editorial board.",
    "[] As Congress and the White House focus on crafting another rescue measure for Americans struggling with the coronavirus, the most important question may be: Can't someone find a way to distract President Trump from his stupid obsession with a payroll tax cut? We've explained before why a payroll tax cut is always an absurd and harmful idea, never more so than in the current crisis. It would undermine the finances of Social Security and Medicare while failing to deliver succor to the Americans who need it most. By pushing to cut off the program’s funding stream, President Trump is taking the first step toward dismantling Social Security. Max Richtman, National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare Trump hasn't been too specific about the cut he demands, but even with a partial reduction in the payroll tax the poorest Americans would receive a few percent of the benefits, and the richest 20% would pocket half to two-thirds of the gains. Trump has been fixed on this idea virtually since the start of his presidential term. Occasionally he has toyed with the idea of eliminating the payroll tax entirely, which would pile stupidity upon stupidity. Never has he offered a thoughtful, logical rationale for cutting the tax wholly or in part. That's true of his reported stance in the latest round of talks about a financial rescue for Americans. Trump has signaled that he won't sign a rescue bill without a payroll tax cut. As for why, all the White House has said about it is that \"President Trump wants to provide relief to hardworking Americans who have been impacted by this virus and one way of doing that is with a payroll tax holiday,” in the words of White House spokesman Judd Deere. “He’s called on Congress to pass this before and he believes it must be part of any phase four package.” Democrats on Capitol Hill are almost certain to treat a payroll tax cut as a nonstarter in negotiations over a rescue package. It isn't a popular idea even among Senate Republicans, who are wisely tetchy about tampering with Social Security in an election year. It's possible that this is just Trumpian blather, and that once a bill is on his desk he'll sign it, payroll tax holiday or not. Let's hope so, and let's explain why. As we've observed, in all his references to a payroll tax cut, Trump has never shown a sign that he understands the payroll tax, what it's used for, or why as a tool to get cash into the hands of Americans it would be worse than any other option. As a reminder, the Social Security payroll tax comes to 12.4% of workers' wage income up to an annually adjusted wage cap (this year: $137,700). Half comes directly out of workers' paychecks, and half is paid by employers. Economists generally attribute the employer portion to employees, on the rather idealistic reasoning that if employers didn't pay it, worker wages would be commensurately higher. An additional 2.9% of wages is deducted for Medicare, also split 50-50 between worker and employer, with no wage cap. A payroll tax cut, therefore, would do nothing to help Americans who need the most help. To benefit from the cut, a worker must be paying the payroll tax. That’s not happening for the roughly 32 million Americans who have filed for unemployment benefits in the last few months because of the pandemic, because by definition they’re no longer on a payroll. The tax cut would have zero benefit for millions of Americans who don’t pay into Social Security, including many state and local workers who aren’t covered by the system and seniors already receiving Social Security benefits, who are no longer paying the tax. Moreover, even for many workers still receiving paychecks, the tax cut would be relatively trivial. If the payroll tax of 6.2% were to be cut in half, that would give a household collecting $50,000 a year in wages a benefit this year of $1,550, or about $30 a week. Households earning the maximum in Social Security-covered wages would receive $4,269, or $82 a week. Labor economists frown on paycheck-based stimulus because it only gets dribbled into household budgets paycheck by paycheck. They prefer the method of stimulus programs in 2001 and 2008 and the CARES Act enacted in March. The CARES Act gave most American households up to $1,200 per adult and $500 per child, with the sums phased out for higher-income families. Studies of the earlier stimulus programs found that recipients pumped as much as 90% of the lump sum payments into the economy within three months. By contrast, paycheck-based programs such as the Obama-era Making Work Pay delivered such small amounts per week or month that many taxpayers weren't even aware they existed. Therefore, the payments barely affected their spending. “Stimulus that is not seen or recognized by individuals is unlikely to affect their sentiment,” former Federal Reserve Governor Claudia Sahm observed. That explains why a payroll tax cut is disdained by economists across the political spectrum. They include Michael R. Strain, director of economic policy studies at the pro-business American Enterprise Institute. Strain wrote in March — the last time Trump was tub-thumping for a payroll tax cut — that the best way to deliver financial relief was by \"sending checks to low-income households in areas with a severe coronavirus outbreak, or who are otherwise economically vulnerable to the virus.\" The worst downside to a payroll tax cut is its potential to undermine Social Security. “By pushing to cut off the program’s funding stream, President Trump is taking the first step toward dismantling Social Security,” Max Richtman, chief executive of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, warned in May. The program will receive nearly 90% of its $1.1 trillion in revenue this year from the payroll tax. That's a dedicated income stream independent of the U.S. Treasury, which was the point of creating the payroll tax. As happened during the Obama administration, when Republicans last insisted on delivering financial assistance to Americans via a payroll tax cut, the lost revenue would presumably be backstopped by transfers from the Treasury. But that's a dangerous change, because it would erode Social Security's fiscal independence and make it easier for the program's enemies to cut benefits. Melding Social Security's dedicated income with that of the federal government at large facilitates no one’s goals except those who want to see the edifice pulled down. That includes Trump, who has spoken openly about\ncutting “entitlements” such as Social Security\nand Medicare benefits. He’s echoing threats made by Republicans such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has portrayed Social Security and Medicare as the cause of the federal deficit, even after he enacted a multibillion-dollar tax cut for corporations and the wealthy in 2017. Need anything more be said? A payroll tax cut has nothing to recommend it, and a multitude of drawbacks. That Trump can't get the idea out of his head may be the best evidence that it makes no sense.",
    "[] WASHINGTON — President Trump announced on Tuesday that he is cancelling the portion of the Republican National Convention that was set to take place in Jacksonville, Fla., next month. The president broke the news at his daily coronavirus briefing and said he made the decision when his political team presented him with plans for the event. “I looked at my team and I said the timing for this event is not right. It’s just not right with what’s happened recently, the flareup in Florida, to have a big convention, it’s not the right time,” Trump said. “I have to protect the American people. That’s what I’ve always done.” The Republican convention is where the party formally nominates its presidential candidates. This year’s edition was originally set to take place in Charlotte, N.C. However, last month, Trump moved the bulk of the event to Jacksonville after North Carolina’s Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper said it would have to be scaled down due to the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, Florida, which was among the first states to reopen, has seen a dramatic increase in coronavirus cases. A number of prominent Republican officeholders said they did not plan to attend. At the briefing, Trump said the portions of the convention that had been scheduled to stay in Charlotte — basically, the formal business sessions — will still go on. That includes the official nomination of candidates for president and vice president, although the number of delegates in attendance will be only 336, many fewer than in previous years. Trump also said he will still make a convention speech. “We’re going to do some other things with tele rallies and online the week that we’re discussing, which will be really good,” said Trump. “And I’ll still do a convention speech in a different form, but we won’t do a big, crowded convention per se. It’s just not the right time for that.” The Democratic Party confirmed its plan for a largely virtual convention last month. Trump’s campaign built up a robust live stream early in the pandemic. But since last month, the president has been trying to resume in-person events, including the large rallies that were a signature of his 2016 campaign. Last month, Trump held his first rally since the pandemic began, in Tulsa, Okla. The event suffered from disappointing attendance and Trump’s frustration contributed to a subsequent shakeup of his campaign team. Even as he announced the cancellation of the convention, Trump insisted his team could have held a “top of the line” event if he wanted to. “The drawings looked absolutely beautiful. I never thought we could have something look so good so fast with everything going on,” Trump said. “Everything was going well … thousands of people wanting to be there and I mean, in some cases, desperately be there. … The pageantry, the signs, the excitement were really, really top of the line.” Trump said officials in Florida did not press him to cancel the convention. He described the decision as motivated by “safety.” “I just felt it was wrong ... to have people going to what turned out to be a hot spot. ... When we chose it, it was not at all hot,” said Trump. Trump also noted he wants to serve as an “example,” and suggested that that objective played a role in his decision. “You know, I could see the media saying, ‘Oh, this is very unsafe.’ I don’t want to be in that position,” Trump said. Yet even while he vowed the revised convention will be “a very nice something,” Trump also waxed nostalgic about the traditional convention floor. “There could be nothing like our last convention, unfortunately. That was a great convention in a great place,” Trump said. “We had a great time in Cleveland.” _____ Read more from Yahoo News: The coronavirus curves are starting to flatten — again.

    "[] President Trump's sparsely attended rally in Tulsa last month cost his campaign more than $2.2 million, according to new federal filings submitted Monday night. The filings show that in June, the campaign paid more than $2.2 million in event, facility, and audiovisual costs, The New York Times reports. The campaign spent $537,705.44 in facility rental payments to the BOK Center, where the rally was held, and nearly $1 million on \"event staging\" fees. The campaign's only major public event that month was the Tulsa rally, which drew a crowd of about 6,200 people; beforehand, Trump's former campaign manager, Brad Parscale, boasted that the campaign received one million ticket requests. These new filings also show that since early 2019, Trump's re-election committee and his shared accounts with the Republican National Committee have spent almost $4 million at Trump-owned properties, the Times reports. One of those shared accounts, the Trump Victory Committee, spent roughly $400,000 on the Trump Hotel Collection in New York, for a donor retreat earlier this year, the Republican National Committee said. Per federal filings, since the beginning of 2019, the biggest congressional spender at Trump properties is Rep. Greg Pence (R-Ind.), Vice President Mike Pence's brother. Trump last visited one of his properties on Monday, attending a fundraiser at his Washington, D.C., hotel that brought in $5 million for the Republican National Committee and his campaign.

    "[] Requiring an excuse for absentee voting. Paying for postage for mail-in ballots. Purging names from voter registration lists. Placing the names on ballots to provide an advantage in so-called \"donkey votes.\" These are among the disputes that have generated a record number of lawsuits over the Nov. 3 election. Decisions in the cases will determine who will vote and how. And the political ground is shifting even during the ongoing primaries, as rulings change in the weeks before votes are cast. “The ease of our ability to cast a vote that will be fairly counted depends in part on where you live,” said Richard Hasen, a law professor at University of California, Irvine and expert on election law. “I think there’s a lot of concern about voting rules, especially given the fact that we’re trying to conduct voting in the midst of a pandemic when the pandemic itself is a major campaign issue and where there is great uncertainty about the future generally.\" The coronavirus pandemic raised the stakes for disputes because restrictions on absentee voting, for example, might discourage people from voting at all. But President Donald Trump has repeatedly blasted mail-in voting, without evidence, for leading to massive electoral fraud and the most rigged election in history. Trump opposed mailing out absentee ballots or applications to all voters, as some states did for the primaries. The closeness of the 2016 election illustrated why candidates and advocacy groups have become so litigious even before the pandemic. Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Republican Trump by nearly 2.9 million votes out of nearly 137 million cast, according to the Federal Election Commission. But Trump won three key states – Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – by a combined 77,744 votes that put him over the top in the electoral college. Lawsuits are setting the ground rules for this year's vote. Democrats have fought to ensure mail-in ballots include postage, to count ballots postmarked – rather than received – by election day, to provide voters a way to remedy discrepancies in signatures that are rejected, and to allow community organizations to collect and deliver sealed ballots. “Frankly this is the thing that keeps me up most at night,” Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, said during a virtual fundraiser Friday. “Making sure everyone who wants to vote can vote. Making sure that the vote is counted, making sure we’re all trusting in the integrity of the results of the election.” Republicans have fought to protect the integrity of voting by opposing mailing ballots to all voters, by preventing group collection of absentee ballots and by ensuring registration lists are updated. \"Mail-In Ballot fraud found in many elections,\" Trump tweeted July 10. \"People are just now seeing how bad, dishonest and slow it is.\" Lawsuits are defining how absentee ballots will be cast, who qualifies and how they can be submitted. The rules could vary between states. And changes from legal decisions could confuse voters and even the election officials working at polling places. James Gardner, a law professor at the University of Buffalo, said restrictions on absentee voting and other requirements for identification and witnesses could discourage voting. “Each of these little annoying things probably doesn’t have much of an effect, but cumulatively they may have an effect,\" Gardner said. “That’s the strategy – to just heap up a mountain of obstacles. Eventually it gets high enough so that Democrats or Democratic leaning independents will not vote.\" Trump's campaign and Republican groups have challenged efforts to ease absentee voting, suing Pennsylvania to change voting by mail by warning it could lead to more fraud. \"Election integrity should not be a partisan issue, yet Democrats are consistently trying to cheat and manipulate election rules to undermine safeguards and security around the November election,\" said Jenna Ellis, Senior Legal Adviser to Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. Candidates, voters, party groups and advocacy groups have filed at least 151 lawsuits related to coronavirus and the election in 41 states through July 15, according to a count by Justin Levitt at Hasen’s electionlawblog.org. The pace is set to eclipse the record number of election lawsuits in 2018, after the number of lawsuits per election cycle tripled in the past 20 years, according to Hasen’s book Election Meltdown: Dirty Tricks, Distrust, and the Threat to American Democracy. The legal challenges come amid growing skepticism about elections. About one in four voters called voter fraud the biggest threat to the election, in an NPR/PBS Marist poll from January. But NPR noted the poll signaled how voters lived in different media bubbles: Voter fraud topped the list of concerns for Republicans and voter suppression was the greatest concern for Democrats. “Election litigation is going up, regardless of the coronavirus,” Hasen said. “Part of it is this culture of disagreement over voting rules and hyperpolarization of society and unclear voting standards and decentralization.” Part of the confusion about election rules stems from state and local governance of how elections are conducted. There are about 10,500 jurisdictions nationwide that administer elections, according to the Government Accountability Office. Voters who don't follow changes in election law closely might not understand changes in requirements for identification or absentee balloting, or the closure of polling places, experts said. Educating voters is something campaigns often undertake, for lack of government resources, experts said. “One thing we often forget is that most voters don’t follow this very closely. It’s very easy for them to get confused,\" said Mark Jones, head of the political science department at Rice University. If a court ruling expands absentee voting, for example, local election officials need time to hire staff, mail out ballots and increase their budgets. “It’s not something that you can do overnight,\" Jones said. Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia allow no-excuse absentee voting. But others require a reason such as a disability to avoid voting in person. Amid the pandemic, lawsuits in states such as Tennessee, Texas and Missouri sought to ease the rules, with mixed results. The Texas Democratic Party sued the state to allow concerns about coronavirus to justify absentee voting in a place where only voters at least 65 years old can vote without an excuse. But state Attorney General Ken Paxton said that “fear of contracting (the virus) unaccompanied by qualifying sickness or physical condition does not constitute a disability under the Texas Election Code for purposes of receiving a ballot by mail.” The state Supreme Court supported Paxton’s interpretation. Democrats then won a ruling in U.S. District Court to distribute an absentee ballot to any eligible voter who wanted one. But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision, saying it would be remembered “more for audacity than legal reasoning.” The U.S. Supreme Court refused July 1 to expedite consideration of the case. Jones, the Rice professor, said the Texas Supreme Court decision allowed younger voters to apply for absentee ballots by checking a box citing a \"disability,\" if they truly believe voting in person could injure their health. But the excuse is still required. \"The difficulty is trying to educate the voters,\" Jones said. \"The Supreme Court has left it in the hands of the voter rather than the county to determine whether they have a disability.\" In Tennessee, a local judge reached a different conclusion. The case involved a few voters who have health problems and filed a lawsuit in Chancery Court because “fear of contracting the coronavirus doesn’t meet the criteria to vote by mail due to illness in Tennessee.” In early June, Davidson County Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle ordered changes to the absentee form so that all 4.1 million voters statewide could vote by mail during the pandemic. She scolded election officials June 11, after forms were changed to segregate pandemic concerns from other excuses for absentee voting including illness and disability. “Shame on you for not following that procedure and just taking matters into your own hands,” Lyle said. She warned that “there always is the specter of criminal contempt if after today’s orders there’s still noncompliance and there’s disobedience.” Secretary of State Tre Hargett cites the Chancery Court decision in a message on the state's election website saying \"if you are a registered voter and do not wish to vote in-person due to the COVID-19 situation, you are eligible to request an absentee ballot by mail.\" Beyond disputes over who can request an absentee ballot, lawsuits in at least eight states have challenged requirements that absentee voters have witnesses confirm their ballots. Minnesota requires the witness to be another registered voter, a notary or somebody who takes oaths to witness and sign an absentee ballot. “The challenged provisions cannot survive judicial scrutiny under any circumstances,” said the lawsuit from Minnesota Alliance for Retired Americans Educational Fund and several voters. “In the context of a pandemic these burdens become entirely unjustifiable, requiring these voters to risk their health to obtain another registered voter’s or notary’s signature, or forfeit their right to vote.” Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon waived the witness requirement for the Aug. 11 primary. But the dispute lingers for the Nov. 3 general election. The tables can turn quickly. Alabama postponed the March 31 Republican Senate runoff between former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former college football coach Tommy Tuberville until July 14 because of health concerns. Between those dates, U.S. District Judge Abdul Kallon ordered the state June 15 not to enforce several of its rules for the runoff, including requiring a notary or two witnesses to sign an absentee ballot and requiring a copy of photo ID for absentee voting. But the U.S. Supreme Court suspended Kallon's order July 2 until the case is argued at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Five states – Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington – hold elections entirely by mail. In addition to Utah, another dozen states with Republican governors include voting by mail as part of no-excuse absentee voting. But Trump has claimed mailed ballots could lead to \"massive election fraud\" this year. In West Virginia, postal carrier Thomas Cooper pled guilty in June to election fraud and injuring the mail after admitting he changed the party affiliation on multiple ballots from Democrat to Republican. In California, the Republican National Committee and the advocacy group Judicial Watch filed separate lawsuits to block Gov. Gavin Newsom’s executive order to send absentee ballots to every active registered voter in the state. The state has allowed counties to hold all voting by mail, but only 15 of the 58 counties did so for the March 3 primary. “Newsom's ‘vote-by-mail’ mandate must be halted now – as mailing millions of ballots to dirty voting lists in violation of the law could cause a constitutional conflagration over the results of the 2020 elections,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. But both groups dropped their lawsuits July 9, after state lawmakers approved legislation to mail ballots to all voters. Newsom had argued that absentee voting was an important option amid a pandemic. The share of ballots submitted by mail grew from 59% in 2016 to 72% for the 2020 primary, according to the state. The pandemic and the public interest “strongly favor providing more ways for Californians to vote, not fewer,” Attorney General Xavier Becerra said. Trump’s campaign, the Republican Party and four Pennsylvania members of Congress sued June 29 to change how the state collects and counts absentee ballots. The lawsuit argued that 67 county election boards and Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar \"have inexplicably chosen a path that jeopardizes election security and will lead – and has already led – to the disenfranchisement of voters, questions about the accuracy of election results, and ultimately chaos\" ahead of the Nov. 3 general election. About 20 counties allowed voters to drop off completed ballots at collection sites without handing them directly to county elections offices, according to the lawsuit. The Trump campaign wants to prevent counting ballots that lack secrecy envelopes, or that have markings identifying the voter or party. The Trump campaign also wants to allow poll watchers to monitor vote counting outside their home counties. The lawsuit claims there was a \"hazardous, hurried and illegal\" roll-out of mail-in voting during the primary that gives \"fraudsters an easy opportunity to engage in ballot harvesting, manipulate or destroy ballots, manufacture duplicitous votes, and sow chaos.\" “Shifting from an absentee voting system to one that pushes unmonitored vote-by-mail creates opportunities for fraud, and encourages ballot harvesting where paid political operatives try to collect and deliver loose ballots,\" said Ellis, the legal adviser to Trump's campaign. The head of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party called the Trump lawsuit an effort to suppress votes as a campaign tactic, noting Democrats far outpaced Republicans in getting their voters to apply for mail-in ballots ahead of the primary. Republican majorities in the state legislature expanded mail-in options last year, said Sincere Harris, executive director of the state Democratic Party. “This voter suppression lawsuit is nothing but a cynical and desperate attempt to silence the voices of Pennsylvanians, because they know that the easier it is for everyday people to vote, the more likely it is that they will lose,” Harris said. In response to the Trump lawsuit, the party and a group of Democratic lawmakers filed a lawsuit in Commonwealth Court to loosen rules for November voting. The lawsuit seeks to extend the deadline for mailed ballots to be postmarked rather than received on election day. The lawsuit also seeks to allow counties to collect mail ballots at drop boxes and to give voters a chance to fix mistakes on mail ballots. \"The stakes in this forthcoming election could not be higher,\" the lawsuit said. \"And any uncertainty or other inconsistency creates heightened space for mischievous havoc and genuine concern.\" Experts including Hasen have argued that mail-in ballot fraud is rare and a small risk compared to the health risks this year. “The principal Republican argument is that mail ballots are more vulnerable to electoral fraud, which is technically correct,\" Jones said. “It’s just to date in the United States, we haven’t had many organized efforts to exploit mail ballots to the full potential.\" One example erupted in a special election May 12 in Paterson, N.J. The election was held entirely by mail because of the pandemic. Under state law, voters are supposed to mail absentee ballots, put them in designated drop boxes or bring them to the county board of elections. Anyone who completes a certification can become a “bearer,” who can collect and deliver ballots for three other voters. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal announced charges last month against four men alleging fraud in casting mail-in ballots, among other charges. Postal inspectors found hundreds of ballots in a local mailbox. Councilman Michael Jackson was charged with procuring multiple ballots that weren't his, including at least one that was unsealed. Alex Mendez, a councilman-elect, was charged with collecting ballots for delivery and submitting registration applications he knew to be false. Grewal said the charges sent a clear message: “If you try to tamper with an election in New Jersey, we will find you and hold you accountable.” But Trump found an even broader threat from mail-in ballots as he highlighted the Paterson case. He argued against governors sending out millions of absentee ballots because of potential fraud. “They’re going to be rigged,” Trump said in Atlanta on July 15. “They’re going to be a terrible situation.” A rare example of federal ballot harvesting upended a 2018 House race in North Carolina. The state elections board ordered a new election in 2019 after refusing to  certify the narrow lead that Republican Mark Harris held over Democrat Dan McCready in unofficial results. One of Harris' political operatives, Leslie McCrae Dowless, allegedly collected absentee ballots from voters in violation of state law and forged signatures, witnesses told the elections board. Dowless was indicted by a Wake County grand jury and charged with possession of absentee ballots and felonious obstruction of justice. GOP Rep. Dan Bishop eventually won the seat in a special election. Another contentious facet of elections deals with updating registration lists when voters die or move. Judicial Watch sued Pennsylvania in an effort to remove ineligible voters from the rolls in three populous counties: Bucks, Chester and Delaware. The state has 800,000 inactive registrations, according to the lawsuit. “Dirty voting rolls can mean dirty elections – that’s one reason why we’re going to court to force Pennsylvania to follow federal law to clean up its voting rolls,” Fitton said. Kathy Bookvar, the secretary of the commonwealth, replied that Pennsylvania makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters by reason of death or change of address. Several voting-rights groups including state chapters of Common Cause and the League of Women Voters, intervened in the case. “We have serious concerns that eligible voters in these three counties could be illegally purged from voter registration rolls,” said Adriel Cepeda Derieux, an attorney with the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project. Voter identification remains a pesky legal issue. In Kentucky, several groups and voters sued in U.S. District Court to overturn a law that requires a voter to include a copy of a photo ID with each application for an absentee ballot, or to sign an affirmation in front of an election officer. One of the plaintiffs, Jeffrey Cosby, 64, of Ashland, has heart, kidney and gallbladder problems and would need his wife to make a copy of his driver’s license, which they want to avoid. “Regardless of whether government offices and businesses reopen soon, all Kentuckians will still face unacceptable risks to vote,” the lawsuit said. Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams denied that the photo ID law placed an unreasonable burden on voters. The case is unresolved. In Wisconsin, a federal case challenged more than a dozen provisions for conducting elections, including voter identification. In a ruling June 29, a three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals scaled back early voting and blocked absentee ballots returned by email or fax – but allowed expired student IDs to continue to be used for voter registration. “On the positive side, the judges ruled that expired photo student IDs can be used as proof of identity to vote,” said Jay Heck, the executive director of Common Cause in Wisconsin, who called the state's rules among the most restrictive in the country. The cost of postage for absentee ballots became the subject of litigation in a half-dozen states even though courts have refused in the past to force states to cover the cost. Voters have argued that requiring postage for absentee ballots amounts to a poll tax, forbidden under the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act. The South Carolina Election Commission reached an agreement July 8 in a U.S. District Court case to provide prepaid postage for absentee ballots in the November election. Marc Elias, one of the lawyers who brought the case on behalf of Democratic Party groups and voters, estimated it could save voters more than $1 million. But the results were different in other southern states, where the cost was considered negligible. In Georgia, the Black Voters Matter Fund argued in a federal lawsuit that while the wealthy might not miss 55 cents for a stamp, lower-income voters could find the cost a burden and younger voters don’t use stamps because of online transactions. “I believe that making voters buy and use their own postage stamps is a poll tax, which is deeply offensive to me as someone raised in the civil rights movement,” said Marilynn Winn, 59, of Fulton County. She doesn’t trust the mail system, but high blood pressure puts her at greater health risk for voting in person. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger called postage, gas or rideshare fares incidental to voting and he denied that they are poll taxes. “Thus, if there is any burden at all, it is quite minimal and, indeed, no different than it has been for decades,” he said. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg declined May 15 to force Georgia to cover postage for the June 9 primary, calling proposed remedies \"not realistic or implementable\" after tens of thousands of ballots were already mailed out. She cited an 11th Circuit decision that refused to force neighboring Florida to pay for postage for absentee ballots. \"Requiring a voter to pay for postage to mail a registration form or ballot to a Supervisor of Elections is not unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful,\" U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle wrote in the Florida case that the 11th Circuit upheld. The U.S. Postal Service said at least in Georgia that it would deliver absentee ballots without postage and then bill county election offices later. The U.S. Supreme Court refused Thursday to hear a case covering nearly a million potential voters in Florida who argued they should be allowed to vote after serving felony sentences even if they can’t pay their fines and restitution. The case will be argued next month in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But voting-rights groups had urged the high court to hear the case faster because of a voter-registration deadline Mondayfor the primary election Aug. 18. \"Under this scheme, nearly a million otherwise-eligible citizens cannot vote unless they pay money,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in opposing the unsigned rejection of the case, calling the state law a \"voter paywall.\" Most states restore felons' right to vote after their sentences and parole are complete. Florida is among 11 states with the most restrictive rules, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Florida adopted a state constitutional amendment in 2018 to allow felons to vote after completing their sentences. But a state law required the felons to pay outstanding fines and restitution before voting. The voters and their advocates contend the state law creates a “wealth barrier” to voting for felons who are unable to pay fines and restitution. They argued that the appeals court decision “creates chaos and confusion about who can and cannot vote, where a wrong guess creates the risk of criminal prosecution.” The state responded that all felons are required to pay fines and restitution regardless of their wealth or indigence, so the voting law isn’t discriminatory. “The State and all Floridians will be irreparably harmed if hundreds of thousands of ineligible voters take part in the upcoming elections,” Charles Cooper, a lawyer for the state, argued. A couple of federal lawsuits sought to change the order of candidates on ballots in Arizona and Florida because of the traditional advantage that the top slot conveys. But federal judges rejected both requests. In Arizona, names rotate on primary ballots because of a state court decision that noted the top position has “a distinct advantage.” But for general elections since 1979, ballots are topped by candidates in the same party as the governor who last won the county. Democratic Party groups and voters challenged the process that they argued tended to benefit Republicans by 2.2% to 4.4%. But U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa dismissed the case after finding that the plaintiffs hadn’t proved that courts should resolve the issue, and hadn’t shown they faced an undue burden. Florida got the same result at a federal appeals court. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker had called the argument that ballot positioning should remain in legislative hands “hogwash.” He found the 1951 Florida law unconstitutional for putting candidates of the same party as the governor first on the ballot. But he didn’t dictate how to fix the problem. The governor has been Republican for 20 years and the advantage to the positioning is estimated as high as 5.4%, according to the lawsuit from Democratic Party groups and voters. The bias is called a “windfall vote” or “donkey vote,” the lawsuit said. “No matter the trappings defendants try to drape it in, this donkey is a donkey, not a racehorse,” Walker wrote. But a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Walker’s decision in April. The panel found that the Democratic groups lacked the standing to sue and hadn’t proved they were injured, leaving the District Court “powerless to provide redress.” This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Elections lawsuits set rules amid COVID-19 pandemic for Nov. 3 election",
    "[] WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump clung to the false notion that the coronavirus will just “disappear,” made incorrect claims about a top government expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and again insisted that Americans are getting all the COVID-19 tests they need — all in a television interview Sunday where his answers fell short on the facts. A look at the president’s alternate reality on the virus threat, as well as his falsehoods on Democratic rival Joe Biden, the economy and the military in a “Fox News Sunday” interview: TRUMP vs, FAUCI TRUMP: “Dr. Fauci at the beginning said, ‘This will pass. Don’t worry about it. This will pass.’ He was wrong.” THE FACTS: Trump is overstating it. While Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official, said in January and February that Americans need not panic about a virus threat at the time, he also said the situation was “evolving” and that public health officials were taking the threat seriously. “Right now the risk is still low, but this could change, I've said that many times,” Fauci told NBC on Feb. 29. He allowed that if there are growing cases of community spread, it could become a “major outbreak.” “When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread,” Fauci said. He never claimed the virus would just \"pass” or disappear. ___ TRUMP: “Dr. Fauci told me not to ban China, it would be a big mistake. I did it over and above his recommendation.” THE FACTS: That's incorrect. While Fauci expressed some initial reservations about travel restrictions on China, he supported the decision by the time it was made. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who was coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force at the time and announced the travel restrictions, said Trump made the decision in late January after accepting the “uniform recommendation of the career public health officials here at HHS.” While the World Health Organization did advise against the overuse of travel restrictions, Azar told reporters in February that his department’s career health officials had made a “considered recommendation, which I and the president adopted” in a bid to slow spread of the virus. ___ TRUMP: “I will be right eventually. You know I said, ‘It’s going to disappear.’ I’ll say it again. It’s going to disappear, and I’ll be right.” TRUMP: “We’ll put out the flames. ... It’s going to be under control.” THE FACTS: “The virus is not going to disappear,” according to Fauci. Nor can it be considered “under control” and its flame “put out” while cases have surged to new daily highs. The number of confirmed cases in the U.S. per day has risen over the past month, hitting over 70,000 this past week, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University. That is higher even than what the country experienced from mid-April through early May, when deaths sharply rose. Fauci has warned that the increase across the South and West “puts the entire country at risk” and that new infections could reach 100,000 a day if people don’t start listening to guidance from public health authorities to wear a mask and practice social distancing. Arizona, California, Florida and Texas have recently been forced to shut down bars and businesses as virus cases surge. The U.S. currently has more than 3.7 million known cases and many more undetected. In February, Trump asserted coronavirus cases were going “very substantially down, not up,” and told Fox Business it will be fine because “in April, supposedly, it dies with the hotter weather.” Fauci says there “certainly” will be coronavirus infections in the fall and winter. ___ TESTING TRUMP: “We go out into parking lots and everything, everybody gets a test.” THE FACTS: He’s repeating the false notion that anybody who wants a COVID-19 test can get one. Americans are being confronted with long lines at testing sites. People often are disqualified if they are not showing symptoms and, if they are tested, they sometimes are forced to wait many days for results. Julie Khani, president of the American Clinical Laboratory Association, which represents LabCorp, Quest Diagnostics and other labs, has made clear that “the anticipated demand for COVID-19 testing over the coming weeks will likely exceed members’ testing capacities.” This past week the group encouraged members to give priority to “those most in need, especially hospitalized and symptomatic patients.” Many governors and local officials say they cannot meet the demand. “Testing has been a challenge everywhere,” says Utah Republican Gov. Gary Herbert. Around Seattle, for instance, a new wave of patients is showing up at emergency departments, said nurse Mike Hastings. “What’s really frustrating from my side of it is when a patient comes into the emergency department, and is not really having symptoms of COVID, but they feel like they need that testing,” said Hastings, who is president of the Emergency Nurses Association. “Sometimes we’re not able to test them because we don’t have enough test supplies, so we’re only testing a certain set of patients.” ___ TRUMP: “Cases are up, because we have the best testing in the world and we have the most testing.” THE FACTS: It’s not true that infections are high only because the U.S. diagnostic testing has increased. Trump's own top public health officials have shot down this line of thinking. Infections are rising because people are infecting each other more than they were when most everyone was hunkered down. Increased testing does play a role in the higher numbers, but there’s more to it. Testing in fact has uncovered a worrisome trend: The percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is on the rise across nearly the entire country. That’s a clear demonstration that sickness is spreading and that the U.S. testing system is falling short. “A high rate of positive tests indicates a government is only testing the sickest patients who seek out medical attention and is not casting a wide enough net,” says the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, a primary source of updated information on the pandemic. ___ TRUMP: “No country has ever done what we’ve done in terms of testing. We are the envy of the world. They call and they say the most incredible job anybody’s done is our job on testing, because we’re going to very shortly be up to 50 million tests. You look at other countries; they don’t even do tests. ... They don’t go around have massive areas of testing, and we do.” THE FACTS: U.S. testing is not the envy of the world, nor is the U.S. the only country that does mass testing. U.S. testing on a per capita basis lags other countries that have done a far better job of controlling their outbreaks. State, local and federal officials are warning of the consequences of testing bottlenecks, including tests rendered useless because results come too late. China has used batch testing, mixing samples and testing them together, as part of a recent campaign to test all 11 million residents of Wuhan. It’s an approach that top U.S. health officials believe could be used to boost U.S. screening, though it’s not clear when pooled testing could become available for wide-scale screenings at U.S. schools and businesses. “We are nowhere near being able to rein in this virus with the amount of testing we have available at the moment,” said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University who previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner. Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said test results in parts of the U.S. take as long as a week, which is “too long.” “You do the testing to find out who’s carrying the virus and then quickly get them isolated so they don’t spread it around,” he said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “And it’s very hard to make that work when there’s a long delay built in.” ___ DEATH RATES TRUMP: “I think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.” CHRIS WALLACE, host of “Fox News Sunday”: “That’s not true, sir.” TRUMP: “Number one, low mortality rate.” THE FACTS: Trump’s claim is wholly unsupported. An accurate death rate is impossible to know. Every country tests and counts people differently, and some are unreliable in reporting cases. Without knowing the true number of people who become infected, it cannot be determined what portion of them die. Using a count kept by Johns Hopkins University, you can compare the number of recorded deaths with the number of reported cases. That count shows the U.S. experiencing more deaths as a percentage of cases than most other countries now being hit hard with the pandemic. The statistics look better for the U.S. when the list is expanded to include European countries that were slammed early on by the virus but now appear to have it under control. Even then, the U.S. is not shown to be among the best in avoiding death. Such calculations, though, do not provide a reliable measurement of actual death rates because of the variations in testing and reporting, and the Johns Hopkins tally is not meant to be such a measure. The only way to tell how many cases have gone uncounted, and therefore what percentage of infected people have died from the disease, is to do another kind of test comprehensively, of people’s blood, to find how many people bear immune system antibodies to the virus. Globally, that is only being done in select places. ___ TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS TRUMP: “If you remember, I was the one that did the European Union very early.” THE FACTS: U.S. health officials actually believe Trump was late in restricting travel from parts of Europe. While Trump imposed travel restrictions on China in late January, he didn’t follow up with many European countries until mid-March. Those delayed travel alerts as well as limited testing contributed to the jump in U.S. cases starting in late February, according to Dr. Anne Schuchat, the No. 2 official at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We clearly didn’t recognize the full importations that were happening,” Schuchat told The Associated Press in May. ___ POLICE TRUMP: “Biden wants to defund the police.” THE FACTS: To be clear, Biden has not joined the call of protesters who demanded “defund the police” after George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis. He’s proposed more money for police, conditioned to improvements in their practices. “I don’t support defunding the police,“ Biden said last month in a CBS interview. But he said he would support tying federal aid to police based on whether “they meet certain basic standards of decency, honorableness and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community, everybody in the community.” Biden’s criminal justice agenda, released long before he became the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee, proposes more federal money for “training that is needed to avert tragic, unjustifiable deaths” and hiring more officers to ensure that departments are racially and ethnically reflective of the populations they serve. Specifically, he calls for a $300 million infusion into existing federal community policing grant programs. That adds up to more money for police, not defunding law enforcement. Biden also wants the federal government to spend more on education, social services and struggling areas of cities and rural America, to address root causes of crime. ___ ECONOMY TRUMP: “I built the greatest economy ever built anywhere in the world; not only of this country, anywhere in the world, until we got hit with the China virus.” THE FACTS: Not true. The economy was healthy back then but not the best in U.S. history, much less world history. Economic gains largely followed along the lines of an expansion that started more than a decade ago under President Barack Obama. And while posting great job and stock market numbers, Trump never managed to achieve the rates of economic growth he promised in the 2016 campaign. The U.S. economy was not the world’s best in history when this started. ___ MILITARY TRUMP: “I got soldiers the biggest pay raises in the history of our military.” THE FACTS: Trump often boasts about the size of the military pay raises under his administration, but there’s nothing extraordinary about them. Several raises in the past decade have been larger than service members are getting under Trump — 3.1% this year, 2.6% last year, 2.4% in 2018 and 2.1% in 2017. Raises in 2008, 2009 and 2010, for example, were all 3.4% or more. Pay increases shrank after that because of congressionally mandated budget caps. Trump and Congress did break a trend that began in 2011 of pay raises that hovered between 1% and 2%. ___ EDITOR'S NOTE — A look at the veracity of claims by political figures. ___ Find AP Fact Checks at http://apnews.com/APFactCheck Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck If you care about the environment, you should start making your peanut butter at home.

    "[] For the first time ever, Congress’ most MAGA contingent on Tuesday decided to test the rule that Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) is the only high-profile Republican who can criticize President Trump and get away with it. By the end of the day, their efforts had made abundantly clear that Cheney can, in fact, still get away with it—at least for now—with her reputation largely unscathed. At a closed-door meeting of House Republicans—their first fully in-person meeting since early March—several lawmakers who present themselves as unflinchingly loyal to Trump took the opportunity to execute what struck some as a coordinated broadside on the third-ranking House Republican. According to Politico, Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Jim Jordan (R-OH), Chip Roy (R-TX), and others attacked Cheney for being insufficiently supportive of Trump and his agenda, for supporting Dr. Anthony Fauci, and for backing a primary challenger to Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), among other things. After the news of the meeting broke, Gaetz upped the ante by publicly calling on Cheney to step down from her position as conference chair. “Liz Cheney has worked behind the scenes (and now in public) against @realDonaldTrump and his agenda,” tweeted Gaetz. “Liz Cheney should step down or be removed.” The call was amplified with a well-timed release of an episode of Gaetz’s podcast, “Hot Takes with Matt Gaetz.” At least one high-profile denizen of Trumpworld clearly heard the call: The president’s son, Donald Trump, Jr., piggybacked on Gaetz’s tweet, saying “We already have one Mitt Romney, we don’t need another.” Trump, Jr. is an influential and well-connected figure in House GOP circles. But, as Cheney pointed out at a press conference later, Trump’s son is “not a member of the House Republican conference.” Ultimately, none of Gaetz’s band of rabblerousers backed his call to remove Cheney from her post—even those who reportedly aired their grievances against her Tuesday morning. In fact, one after the other, those reportedly involved changed the subject. “I am focused on making sure the President wins re-election and helping us take back the majority. I want to stay focused on that, that should be what we’re doing,” said Jordan, when asked if he had confidence in Cheney. “We had a good robust private conversation,” Roy said—and called Cheney a friend, “just like all my other colleagues in this conference are friends. We’re going to get busy making sure we’re going to win this fall.” And Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY), who was not at the meeting but is close to the Trump family, also declined to take the bait on Cheney, telling The Daily Beast, “I’ve gotten along with her the entire time that she’s been here. And my interactions with her, where we’re aligned on issues, has been only positive.” Other Republicans chided the push: Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-MI), who is retiring, said it was a bit “extreme” to try to oust Cheney over her views on Trump. “She’s done what she thinks is right,” said Mitchell. “I’m not endorsing it, it’s just if that’s the criteria we use, I don’t think unquestioning support of the president is in the job description of conference chair.” Trump himself, meanwhile, did not publicly weigh in on the dust-up, and to date has never publicly attacked Cheney in the merciless style he’s gone after other Republicans he views as critical of him. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Cheney and the GOP meeting. With the would-be insurgents largely silent, Cheney ended the day pocketing public praise from allies and the full backing of House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who appeared beside her at a press conference and proclaimed “we’re honored to have her as conference chair.” Privately, too, many Republicans seethed at the optics of outspoken male lawmakers going after a highly visible Republican woman. “Where is the party struggling right now? With women,” said one House Republican aide. “And the game plan is to go after the top female elected Republican in all of Congress?” “There is zero appetite,” said another House Republican aide, “to get rid of the only woman in leadership.” Indeed, it was unlikely that a fit from House conservatives, who historically love to rattle their leaders, would result in any meaningful effort to oust Cheney. But their first shot at it may portend future turbulence within the Republican Party—especially a post-Trump party that so many believe that Cheney is positioning herself to lead. The timing of the attack, which was unconnected to any specific bit of news or provocation by Cheney, was “quite intentional,” according to a former House Republican aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe conference dynamics freely. “It’s also misplaced and purely personal. Cheney is a strong supporter of the President, wants him to win in November, and is arguably more conservative than those chirping,” said the aide. “But, those that have risen in influence because of President Trump’s personal and punch-driven politics made it clear today they will not go quietly if he falls in November. The fight for the future of the Republican Party has broken out into the open.” The third-term congresswoman’s willingness to push back on Trump at all—where she could easily remain silent or supportive of him—has given rise to chatter that she is planning for a future where the party has moved on from Trump. Her criticisms of Trump have hardly risen to the level of someone like Romney, who voted with Democrats in an impeachment Cheney slammed as permanently damaging to the country. According to trackers like FiveThirtyEight, Cheney has voted more frequently with Trump’s agenda in her career than detractors questioning her loyalty to the president, such as Gaetz, who did time of his own in the White House doghouse in January over his high-profile fight to rein in Trump’s war powers on Iran. But within the House GOP’s Trump cheering section, Cheney’s at-times harsh criticism has stuck out—particularly when it comes to Trump’s national security platform and the petty controversies the president reflexively kicks up regularly—putting her in contrast with Republicans like Jordan, who have thrown in their lot so clearly with the president that the association will be hard to shake, no matter what happens to him in November. Indeed, Trump’s political fortunes were a focal point of the closed-door discussion Tuesday morning, with Cheney’s critics accusing her of undermining the president’s chances at reelection and saying she wasn’t a “team player.” Cheney, a top fundraising officer on the Trump campaign, reportedly parried the attacks with subtle digs at her rivals, wishing Gaetz luck on his new HBO documentary and raising Jordan’s past reputation as anything but a team player. But leaving that meeting, Cheney illustrated a reason why she’s been able to get so far while lodging criticism of the president—picking her battles. \"We had an exchange of views,” Cheney told reporters, saying not a word about what she’d just confronted. “I think it's all clear we're unified in terms of recognizing the danger... if Joe Biden were elected President. We talked at length about Vice President Biden, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and the kind of America we'd be living in if they prevail. That was really the focus of it. We had a healthy exchange of views.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!

    "[] WASHINGTON – Attorney General William Barr, facing a hotly anticipated appearance before a House panel Tuesday, offered a forceful defense of his actions as the nation's chief law enforcement officer, asserting that he has acted apart from the interests of the White House while \"applying a standard of justice without partisan considerations.\" Even before taking office in 2019, Barr said he became \"deeply troubled by what I perceived as the increasing use of the criminal justice process as a political weapon and the emergence of two separate standards of justice.\" \"The Department had been drawn into the political maelstrom and was being buffeted on all sides,\" Barr said in an opening statement prepared for delivery Tuesday to the House Judiciary Committee. When he was asked to consider returning for a second term as attorney general (following his service in the George H.W. Bush administration), Barr said he did so because \"I revere the Department and believed my independence would allow me to help steer her back to her core mission of applying one standard of justice for everyone and enforcing the law even-handedly, without partisan considerations.\" Of mounting questions about favorable decisions rendered in a series of cases involving President Donald Trump and his allies, Barr said that his actions \"have been my own.\" \"And they have been made because I believed they were right under the law and principles of justice,\" according to Barr's statement. Barr's long-sought testimony comes as part of House Democrats' investigation into allegations of political interference at Justice and claims that the attorney general has turned the department into a political annex of the Trump White House. The hearing, billed as an oversight of the Justice Department, will touch on a year's worth of grievances, from the widely criticized roll-out of the special counsel's Russia report in 2019 to the deployment of federal agents to Portland. 'What had happened was wrong': DOJ lawyers accuse agency leaders of abusing power in Roger Stone case, other probes Unrest in Portland: Portland police detain two suspects after reported shooting near federal courthouse protest site House Democrats are expected to lob questions from a long list of issues, including whether he mischaracterized the findings of former special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, interference on the criminal prosecutions of Trump allies, the contentious ouster of Manhattan's former U.S. attorney, and the federal agents' use of force to clear Lafayette Square of protesters in Washington D.C. ahead of a presidential photo-op, according to the House committee's counsel. In his opening statement, Barr referred to the Russia investigation as \"bogus,\" and that he has paid a political price for his actions since. \"Ever since I made it clear that I was going to do everything I could to get to the bottom of the grave abuses involved in the bogus “Russiagate” scandal, many of the Democrats on this Committee have attempted to discredit me by conjuring up a narrative that I am simply the President’s factotum who disposes of criminal cases according to his instructions,\" he said. \"Judging from the letter inviting me to this hearing, that appears to be your agenda today.\" Lawmakers also are expected to question Barr about recent federal officer deployments to quell rioting in Portland and in support of Operation Legend, a federal crime-fighting initiative that the Justice Department recently expanded to multiple cities amid resistance and skepticism from local officials. The rioting and demonstrations against police brutality initially prompted by the May 25 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police have only grown more intense since the deployment of federal officers. While Barr said that police abuses remain rare, he said Floyd's death and others like it \"strike a deep chord in the black community because they are perceived as manifestation of the deeper, lingering concern that, in encounters with police, blacks will not be treated even-handedly; they will not be given the benefit of the doubt; they will be treated with greater suspicion than a white person would be in the same circumstances.\" Former US Attorney Geoffrey Berman: AG Barr pressed him to resign to make way for favored candidate Geoffrey Berman firing: AG Barr's glowing account of NY prosecutor's work further clouds dismissal \"I think these concerns are legitimate,\" Barr said in the statement, though he suggests that police shouldn't bear all of the blame. \"I think it would be an oversimplification to treat the problem as rooted in some deep-seated racism generally infecting our police departments,\" Barr said. \"It seems far more likely that the problem stems from a complex mix of factors, which can be addressed with focused attention over time.\" Republicans have cast the committee's investigation as a political stunt that distracts from more pressing issues, such as the coronavirus pandemic and racial unrest. They also have defended Barr, saying his actions at the Justice Department were meant to correct the wrongs of the previous administration. The hearing, expected to be long and contentious, follows testimony from current and former Justice Department officials who accused the agency's leadership of impropriety. Last month, a Justice Department prosecutor said the department's leadership gave Roger Stone, a longtime friend of the president, \"unprecedentedly favorable treatment\" by pushing for a more lenient prison sentence against the recommendation of career prosecutors. Aaron Zelinsky told lawmakers he and the other attorneys who prosecuted the GOP operative were pressured to \"cut Stone a break,\" or they could be fired. Around the same time, Barr and ousted Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman publicly clashed over control of one of the Justice Department's most prestigious offices that have investigated and prosecuted Trump's allies and former associates. During a chaotic weekend last month, Berman accused Barr of not being truthful after the Justice Department announced – prematurely, according to Berman – that he was leaving his post. 'What a disaster': Aggressive federal response in Portland raises legal questions Federal deployments: Mayors see broken trust, political agenda in Trump's surge of federal officers to US cities The weekend ended with Berman's firing. Berman later testified that Barr repeatedly pressed him to resign to make way for Trump's desired nominee, telling him he would be fired if he refused to do so and even offering a high-ranking position within the Justice Department. During the closed-door testimony, Berman said he questioned why he was being asked to leave before a nominee is confirmed and was critical of Barr's decision to appoint an outsider as a temporary replacement, calling it \"unprecedented, unnecessary and unexplained.\" Berman declined to speculate on Barr's motives, but he said the attorney general's \"irregular and unexplained actions\" were problematic, according to a transcript of the testimony.

    "[] By conventional standards, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube showed themselves to be paragons of public service Monday when they took down a video promoting a long-debunked \"cure for COVID\" and agitating against mask-wearing. The conservative broadcast chain Sinclair also has been praised in some quarters for canceling a segment on one of its television shows promoting an especially unhinged assertion that Dr. Anthony Fauci played a role in manufacturing coronaviruses and sending them to China. By real-world standards, however, the social media giants and Sinclair failed miserably. We're a supporter of free speech and a marketplace of ideas and viewpoints, even if incredibly controversial. Sinclair Broadcast Group The video remained up on Facebook for hours, long enough to garner more than 14 million views, and reportedly can still be found by determined searchers. Twitter not only deleted the video, but also restricted the account of Donald Trump Jr., who had posted the video on his account. The suspension was to last only 12 hours, however. And Sinclair came close to providing a platform to the claim about Fauci embodied in a video documentary titled \"Plandemic.\" Concerns about the firms' inability — or unwillingness — to police their platforms for manifestly deceptive misinformation and disinformation may surface Wednesday during a joint appearance before the House Judiciary Committee by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple Chairman Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet, which owns Google and YouTube. The session's nominal topic is the market power accumulated by these giant corporations, but the power of social media platforms to distribute dangerous myths is certainly pertinent. Indeed, Darrell M. West of the Brookings Institution suggested that one of the questions that should be high on the lawmakers' agenda is: \"What have you done to stop the use of your products for racist appeals, hateful actions, or false information?\" It's fair to say that inoculating these platforms against informational toxins isn't always a simple matter, in part because distinguishing the purveying of disinformation from legitimate differences of opinion, especially on scientific matters, isn't always easy. Some of the conspiracy theories that leach into social media come cloaked with the aura of government statements, thus providing a convenient defense against calls to remove the material. Consider the case of President Trump, whose Twitter output is not only voluminous — more than 50 tweets on Monday alone — but also chockablock with tweeted and retweeted conspiracy claims and false assertions. The Washington press event at the center of the controversial video Monday was fronted by Rep. Ralph Norman, a far-right member of the South Carolina Republican delegation. As we've reported, the ability of misinformation and conspiracy-mongering to infect our public discourse is greater than ever before because its sources are no longer limited to inhabitants of the lunatic fringe or commercial entities that have profited from misleading the public, such as tobacco companies. The speed with which this material can reach the public makes a mockery of the old saw about how a lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on — today, a lie can metastasize throughout the global body politic before the truth can even get out of bed. The defense for posting and publishing such noxious material long has been that exposing it to the public has a disinfectant effect — the public will be able to weigh it against truth and serious discourse, and it will wither away as a result. The power of social media to give such material credibility merely by making it public points to the question of whether some viewpoints are just too noxious. There should be no question that Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and their cousins could be much better at blocking some of this material before it can reach millions of viewers. For one thing, some of it has long since been established as mendacious or deceptive. A Facebook spokesman says the video was removed \"for sharing false information about cures and treatments for COVID-19.\" https://t.co/dTKZMHL7GF Let's consider the video involved in Monday's controversy. Originally posted by the right-wing Breitbart News, the video featured a group of white-coated doctors associated with organizations calling themselves America’s Frontline Doctors and the Assn. of American Physicians and Surgeons. Neither of these organizations nor many of the participants are unknown to followers of conspiracy theories or debunkers of pseudoscience. The head of America's Frontline Doctors, Simone Gold, an emergency room physician, has described advice to wear masks as “a con of massive proportion.” She says the media has “an agenda ... to make you think that there’s no actual facts out there that you can discern for yourself. ... That’s\na really good way to let people live in fear\n.” Gold, by the way, was a member of the so-called \"expert panel\" assembled by the Orange County Board of Education as window-dressing for its \"white paper\" advocating irresponsibly that schools in the county reopen for class without masks or social distancing. The thrust of the video was to promote the use of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. The persistence of the claim for this nostrum, which has been incessantly talked up by President Trump, is simply astonishing given that every randomized clinical trial of the treatment, the gold standard in clinical studies, has found it to be ineffective against the virus (and hazardous for some patients besides). Yet the videotaped event featured Stella Immanuel, a Houston physician who claims to have treated more than 350 patients with hydroxychloroquine and \"they're all well.\" She called the studies debunking the drug's effectiveness \"fake science\" and said, \"You don't need masks; there is a cure.\" Immanuel maintains on her website that \"serious gynecological problems, Marital distress, miscarriages, impotence, untold hardship, financial failure and general failure\" are caused by \"evil spiritual marriages.\" After Facebook took down Monday's video, she issued a sort of curse against the company via Twitter: \"Put back my profile page and videos up or your computers will start crashing till you do.\" Hello Facebook put back my profile page and videos up or your computers with start crashing till you do. You are not bigger that God. I promise you. If my page is not back up face book will be down in Jesus name. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube would have us believe that they were caught flatfooted for hours by this material. Then there's Sinclair, which played a more active role in distributing patent disinformation than the social media platforms, until public disclosure caused it to backtrack. Sinclair is a rapidly expanding broadcast conglomerate that now operates more than 190 television stations coast-to-coast. The right-wing tenor of its news content suggests that it's hoping to share the conservative market with Fox, if not surpass its rival. Over the weekend, Sinclair was prepared to give a platform to a participant in a certain video known as \"Plandemic.\" Clips of the video don't seem to be available as of this writing from the production's website, but as pseudoscience debunker Dennis Gorski reported in May, the blurb for the video included statements such as this: \"The media has generated so much confusion and fear that people are begging for salvation in a syringe. Billionaire patent owners are pushing for globally mandated vaccines. Anyone who refuses to be injected with experimental poisons will be prohibited from travel, education and work. No, this is not a synopsis for a new horror movie. This is our current reality.\" The participant was Judy Mikovits, who was to be featured in a segment of Sinclair's show \"America This Week,\" interviewed by host Eric Bolling, a former Fox News host. Mikovits' professional career was subjected to scrutiny earlier this year by Science Magazine, which did not paint a pretty picture. In the Sinclair segment, according to a clip and a transcript published by Media Matters for America, Mikovits states, \"I believe Dr. Fauci has manufactured the coronaviruses in monkey cell lines and shipped them from and paid for and shipped the cell lines to Wuhan, China, now for at least since 2014.\" Bolling subsequently brought on a guest who disputed the claim that Fauci was involved in manufacturing the novel coronavirus, though she maintained that the virus was likely made in a laboratory (another highly dubious assertion). Sinclair at first defended its program. \"We're a supporter of free speech and a marketplace of ideas and viewpoints, even if incredibly controversial.\" We also interviewed a medical expert who debunked Dr. Mikovitz’s claims as conspiracy theories. We’re a supporter of free speech and a marketplace of ideas and viewpoints, even if incredibly controversial. But that won't do. The defense of pandering to ignorance in the name of informational \"balance\" is an old stunt that depends on portraying disagreements as \"controversies\" even when no real controversy exists. (We took Katie Couric to task in 2013 when she aired an interview with an anti-vaccination activist as though she was merely reporting the controversy, and she quite properly conceded the misstep.) In the Sinclair case, there is no controversy about Fauci's role in the coronavirus. No serious evidence that he played any such role exists. Sinclair at first responded to \"feedback\" about the Bolling segment by delaying the broadcast but subsequently pulled the plug entirely, telling CNN that \"given the nature of the theories [Mikovits] presented we believe it is not appropriate to air the interview.\" It's gratifying, one supposes, that the limits of Sinclair's shame and sensitivity to public \"feedback\" have been determined. But it was a close call. Sinclair should never have given a platform to Mikovits' claim, for any effort to check it out would have revealed the dangers of putting it on the air. The question is whether Sinclair has learned anything from the episode — just as the question is whether Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have learned that it's imperative to address videos such as the hydroxychloroquine news conference proactively.

    "[] You've seen the videos: armored police shooting objects into crowds in Portland, teargassing the city's mayor and beating protesters who stand in the way of their tactical advances. But why are federal officers in Portland, and have they fueled violence as critics and city officials claim? How did Portland become the epicenter of protests against police violence? Portland had seen nearly 40 consecutive nights of protests against police violence and systemic racism after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, but city officials say the nightly demonstrations were dwindling when the Department of Homeland Security decided on July 4 to increase its presence around Portland's federal courthouse. What happened at the federal courthouse? On the night of July 3, a small group of people shattered a glass door at the federal building, which is within a block of both the Multnomah County Justice Center — home to a local jail — and a city police precinct, both of which had been earlier focuses of anti-police violence protests. Prosecutors later accused the group of attempting to set a fire. The incident prompted the Department of Homeland Security to act on an executive order issued a week earlier by President Trump, authorizing the agency to prioritize enforcement against the \"vandalism of government property.\" In the weeks since, the federal presence — dubbed \"Operation Diligent Valor\" — has ballooned to include at least 114 federal officers not usually stationed at the courthouse. As local officials decried the federal government's dramatic response to vandalism, blaming it for reigniting protests, dozens have been arrested at the nightly demonstrations, and at least one man claims to have been pulled by unidentified federal agents into an unmarked minivan while walking blocks away. He said he was released without charges. Dozens more protesters, journalists and federal agents have been injured — one protester holding a stereo over his head suffered a fractured skull after being shot by a U.S. Marshal in the head with a so-called less than lethal projectiles. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler was among those tear-gassed, and in a viral video, Christopher David, a 53-year-old Navy veteran, was shown being beaten by federal officers. In court documents, federal officials said at least 28 officers have been injured. How much damage has been done to the courthouse? Officials have estimated at least $50,000 in costs to clean up graffiti, broken glass and fix security equipment. Are Portland police and federal officers working together? The Portland City Council on July 23 voted to bar city police from working with federal law enforcement. They had previously coordinated responses to the protests. Who are the federal police stationed at the Portland courthouse? Though courthouse protection is typically the purview of the Federal Protective Service and the U.S. Marshals, \"Operation Diligent Valor\" includes agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), according to a federal court declaration by Gabriel Russell, who is commanding the operation. The group includes members of an elite unit called the Border Patrol Tactical Unit, according to officials. Why is Border Patrol allowed to patrol a Portland courthouse? Portland, like most of the United States' major cities, falls within the so-called \"100-mile zone\" that defines CBP's jurisdiction, according to the University of Illinois Springfield professor Deborah Anthony, who has studied the agency's expanding operations in that corridor. She said CBP is free to operate within 100 miles of any border or coastline, a swath of land that's home to roughly two-thirds of the country's population. \"It's based on a statute from the 1940s that says border agents can search the border for aliens within a reasonable distance of the border or an external boundary. In 1953, a (Department of Justice) regulation determined that that was a hundred miles. Nobody seems to really know why they came up with a hundred miles, but that's essentially been the rule ever since,\" Anthony said. At the time there were about 1,000 border agents nationwide, compared with roughly 21,000 today. Can they really detain anyone inside the 100-mile zone? No, Anthony said. \"What they are supposed to be doing within that 100 miles is very limited. The charge of customs and border protection is facilitating trade customs and immigration law. And so they really are not supposed to be doing other types of operations, crime control, things like that, even within the 100 miles.\" She said the agency's involvement in an operation like \"Operation Diligent Valor\" in Portland is unusual. \"It's the first I'm aware of because as far as I'm aware, it has nothing to do with immigration.\" Why is the attorney general sending federal officials to Chicago, Kansas City and Albuquerque? While President Trump appeared to have conflated the two operations on July 20, they are not exactly the same. His executive order and the Portland operation are ultimately focused on enforcement of federal law, on federal property. Attorney General William Barr's July 22 announcement pertained to officials with the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, DEA, and ATF potentially assisting local police in the enforcement of local laws, with an effort toward curbing crime in those cities. Can federal officials go to cities and enforce local laws? Only if they're invited, according to Ohio State University law professor Peter Shane. \"There's no kind of overarching statutory authority for federal agencies, in general, to send federal officers to assist in local law enforcement,\" Shane said. \"If there is a request for federal help, the federal government can provide that help, but there has to be a request.\" Have the cities requested federal help? No, the mayors of all three cities were among 14 to sign a letter condemning Homeland Security's role in Portland, and the mayors of Albuquerque and Kansas City have explicitly said they are not asking for federal cooperation in local law enforcement. The U.S. Attorneys in both cities have said federal agents will be focused on violent federal crimes. Chicago's mayor, Lori Lightfoot, said federal agents will be allowed to \"work in partnership\" with Chicago detectives investigating gun homicides.

    "[] While the vast majority of public health experts now agree that wearing face masks could halt the worsening coronavirus pandemic in its tracks, some Americans continue to resist that guidance. More than two dozen states now have rules requiring residents to wear masks in stores and public areas. Big-box retailers like Target and Walmart have mandated that shoppers don a face covering to frequent their establishments. But the more that masks become embedded in everyday life, the more some people continue to push back. Fueled by mistrust of mainstream information, inconsistent messaging and concerns over the legality of mask mandates, there are some groups across the country that are organizing in protest of mask orders. Broadcast on social media, confrontations over mask orders continue to erupt inside local businesses, with some turning violent. “The majority of people seem to be following the recommendation, but research [shows] that there’s a small group of people who, when they feel like they’re being controlled, will respond by acting out,” Vaile Wright, senior director of Health Care Innovation at the American Psychological Association, told Yahoo News. “That might look like breaking the law or, in this case, not following medical recommendations.” This behavior, Wright says, is influenced by a sense of distress and a lack of understanding of why the masks are necessary. It was also made worse by the fact that officials at the World Health Organization, in an effort to ensure that face masks went first to frontline health care workers, declared that masks were not recommended for everyone. “You’ve got this huge sense of distrust of the government,” Wright said, “whether it’s local or federal. You’ve got distrust in the science. And then you have this really unfortunate situation where the science changed — science does that, especially in certain situations that are so novel and uncertain, but that’s really confusing for people.” By a large margin, the U.S. has more confirmed COVID-19 cases (4.3 million) and deaths from it (nearly 150,000) than any other country, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Yet for months, as the number of cases and the death toll have continued to rise, public health experts have issued more unified guidance that wearing a mask can help the country contain the pandemic. Still, some Americans — like Kansas resident Daniel Dieker, who avoids wearing masks except at doctors’ offices — aren’t entirely convinced that masks work. “I don’t think the masks are effective at all,” Dieker, 34, told Yahoo News via Facebook. He said he knows of only one person with a confirmed case of the coronavirus. That person had mild symptoms, Dieker said. “I’m not concerned about COVID-19 because everything I see adds up to inflated numbers and overhyped panic. I believe it’s no worse than a new influenza strain.” Dieker didn’t identify specific sources for that view, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says influenza and COVID-19 are caused by different viruses. Instead, Dieker pointed to what he described as misreported case numbers, inaccurate tests and mainstream news articles he believes are untrue. “If I’m lied to several times,” he said, “why would I continue to believe the source of the lie, especially when the narrative doesn’t add up?” Masks are also uncomfortable, Dieker said. Dr. Steven Taylor, a psychiatrist at the University of British Columbia and the author of the 2019 book “The Psychology of Pandemics,” attributes the aversion to masks to several factors. Covering your face is not the norm in American culture, Taylor said, so it can be difficult for people to adjust to wearing one all the time. Also, he noted, some political leaders have taken the virus more seriously than others, sending mixed messages to the public. President Trump, for instance, falsely said on Tuesday that large portions of the country are “corona-free,” and has vacillated between telling citizens to wear masks and sharing misinformation that downplays the importance of face coverings. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday. Having often resisted wearing a mask, Gohmert said in an interview that he “can’t help but wonder” if wearing a mask and trying to keep it in place caused him to breathe in the virus. This is not the first time Americans have resisted wearing masks during a public health crisis. “In 1919 in San Francisco, there was an attempt by the authorities to make masks mandatory” during the so-called Spanish flu, Taylor said. “That caused the creation of the Anti-Mask League. The reasons they offered back then to not wearing masks are the same as the ones we’re seeing today. The people in the Anti-Mask League said, ‘We’re not going to wear masks because we don’t think they’re effective. And they’re an infringement on our civil liberties.’ So everything old is new again.” The resistance to wearing masks may stem from America’s culture of individualism, which prioritizes personal freedom above practically everything else. Michele Gelfand, a cross-cultural psychologist and professor at the University of Maryland, says the country’s response to the pandemic has much to do with what she calls its “loose” culture, compared with “tight” countries, such as Germany and Singapore, with a stricter adherence to social norms. In a Boston Globe op-ed in March, Gelfand described U.S. culture’s “decentralized, defiant, do-it-your-own-way norms that make our country so entrepreneurial and creative and also deepen our danger during the coronavirus crisis.” “It’s harder for people to accept when you have to become more strict,” Gelfand, the author of “Rule Makers, Rule Breakers: How Tight and Loose Cultures Wire Our World,” told Yahoo News. Her article, published before the number of COVID-19 cases would skyrocket here, warned that the U.S. must “tighten up” to survive the coronavirus. “I was trying to nudge the American public about the fact that our loose entrepreneurial spirit is really important and we don’t want to give that up,” she said, “but that under times of threat, we really need to start becoming more strict in terms of social rules in order to survive.” For John Bruski, a 47-year-old pastor from St. Paul, Minn., the mask mandates and COVID-19 restrictions are about submission. “It is a symbol of your silence,” he told Yahoo News via Facebook. “This whole thing has been about shutting down our voice. No gathering, essentially attacking churches, no family gatherings. Close the restaurants so you can’t gather. Close or control everything that has to do with our voices and relationships.” Bruski said he believes the mandates are “wrong and unconstitutional,” a claim echoed by mask opponents and some attorneys general. But state laws generally give governors broad powers to make decisions in the interest of public health, despite whether residents believe them to be necessary. “No one’s saying you have to believe that this is real,” Gerard Magliocca, a constitutional scholar and law professor at Indiana University, told Yahoo News. “You just have to wear a mask. I don’t think any court is going to say a mask requirement is invalid unless you go the route of saying, ‘There's nothing in state law that says that you can require people to wear masks at all.’” Experts warn that the same issues surrounding mask compliance could create problems for promoting a vaccine. “We know that vaccination nonadherence is already a big problem for seasonal influenza,” said Taylor, who has been conducting public surveys on the topic. “It’s going to be even worse for getting the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. And that’s because it’s an unknown virus. The vaccine doesn’t have a track record yet. People are concerned about the safety and efficacy of a vaccine and worry that the whole process is being rushed. So that’s the next big challenge ahead.” Dieker echoed those concerns, saying he would not get a vaccine until it was widely tested and approved for effectiveness and safety. “The rushed process makes it easier for issues to be missed,” he said. Bruski told Yahoo News he is not an “anti-vaxxer” but would not take the vaccine because he believes it’s “totally unnecessary” and probably wouldn’t work anyway. “I think it’s the same psychological process that you see for masks,” Wright said. “Again, this sense of not wanting to feel controlled by others in what already feels like an uncontrollable situation.” Public health experts have said that the way to effectively promote mask use is to offer consistent messaging that persuades, not forces, people to take precautions for themselves and their community. “It’s really about depoliticizing masks in general,” Wright said, “and instead making the messaging about doing this as a way to protect your country, to protect you and to protect your community. And that as citizens, that comes with a certain amount of freedoms and price, but it also comes with responsibility. And in this case, that responsibility is to protect the public health.” _____ Read more from Yahoo News: The coronavirus curves are starting to flatten — again.

    "[] Tech billionaire Peter Thiel has given $850,000 to a super PAC that's backing Kris Kobach's US Senate run in Kansas, Recode reported Tuesday. Thiel previously donated money to pro-Kobach groups during his failed 2018 bid for governor, and is closely aligned with his anti-immigration policies, according to Recode. Thiel has been looking for congressional candidates to put his money behind since abandoning Trump's reelection campaign earlier this month, saying the president faces slim prospects in November. Thiel is rare among Silicon Valley elites in his support of Trump and his anti-immigrant positions, despite having been born overseas himself. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Tech billionaire Peter Thiel has thrown his money behind US Senate candidate Kris Kobach. Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo; Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Tech billionaire Peter Thiel has been spending big in a US Senate race in Kansas, pumping $850,000 into a super PAC called Free Forever that backs Kris Kobach for the seat, Recode reported Tuesday. During a fundraiser at his New York City penthouse last fall, Thiel told attendees that he would put his money behind Kobach — a hard-line Republican who was once in the running to be President Donald Trump's immigration czar — in an effort to take on the GOP establishment candidate, according to Recode. Kobach is running against Rep. Roger Marshall, the preferred establishment candidate, in a race that could turn the historically red state into a key 2020 battleground as Republicans increasingly worry about keeping control of the Senate. But Thiel's motivations appear to be geared more toward gaining new potential allies in Washington, according to Recode. While he has been one of Trump's few high-profile supporters in the tech industry, Thiel backed away from the president's reelection campaign earlier this month, saying he thought Trump had a slim chance at winning in November. Since then, he has financially backed Sen. Tom Cotton and gotten closer with Sen. Josh Hawley (who shares Thiel's criticisms of Google's business in China as unpatriotic), Recode reported. Kobach and Thiel are similarly in favor of stricter immigration policies, and Thiel is a co-founder of Palantir, a data analytics firm that works closely with US immigration enforcement agencies. The two have crossed political and financial paths before as well. Gawker reported in 2008 that Thiel had donated to anti-immigration group NumbersUSA, which has since become a vocal backer of Kobach. Thiel also served on Trump's transition committee that had considered Kobach for immigration czar. More recently, The Kansas City Star reported that Thiel had funneled at least $100,000 to a \"dark money\" group backing Kobach. Thiel's tech industry résumé includes co-founding PayPal, sitting on Facebook's board, and starting VC firm Founders Fund, but he has also attracted controversy along the way with his politics. In a 2009 essay, Thiel argued that American democracy has declined since women got the right to vote, and in the early days of Trump's presidency, Thiel supported his widely decried travel ban on refugees from Muslim-majority countries. \"He has a really strong preference for people who stick their middle finger up to the status quo and conventional wisdom,\" a source close to Thiel told Recode, adding: \"There is nobody who I think was more obviously sticking his middle finger up at conventional wisdom quite like Kris Kobach.\" Read the original article on Business Insider",
    "[] In 2017, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), in their infinite wisdom, granted a pair of filmmakers unprecedented behind-the-scenes access to their officers and facilities. And for nearly three years, Christina Clusiau and Shaul Schwarz captured the human toll of Trump’s zero tolerance immigration policy, which saw undocumented families ripped apart and placed in ruinous detention centers. According to Clusiau and Schwarz, ICE—who were contractually allowed to review cuts of the series but to only request edits for privacy violations or factual errors—demanded that the series’ release be held until after the 2020 election, and that the request came from “all the way to the top,” reported The New York Times. Despite governmental pressure, the resulting 6-part docuseries, Immigration Nation, is hitting Netflix on Aug. 3. And it may be the most devastating viewing experience of the year. The action opens on April 9, 2018, three days after then Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that federal agencies must “adopt immediately a zero-tolerance policy for all offenses” related to illegal entry into the U.S. We see ICE agents conduct a raid on a New York City apartment in the dead of night, refuse to show the mother a warrant, and take her husband away. We’re then transported inside ICE’s New York field office and witness firsthand the cruelty of the agents, who giggle while taking iPhone video of a man in detention as he shudders in fear and hits his head repeatedly against a wall; cheer the fact that they “got another one”; and casually eat fruit while staring at a detained man with a sheet over his head in a holding cell. “I have a good, stable home. I make good money. To be called a Nazi, a racist—it’s ignorant. It’s ignorant,” says one ICE field officer. “We don’t pick and choose groups of people based on race, color, religion. We just look for people who are removable.” Inside Will and Jada Pinkett Smith’s Scientology School for Kids Did the CIA Torture an Undercover DEA Agent for a Mexican Drug Cartel? Under previous administrations, ICE prioritized those who commit serious crimes. Under Trump, as one ICE official explains, “We’re arresting all immigration violators—if you get convicted of a crime or not.” There are also a high number of what agents call “collaterals”—or undocumented people not even accused of committing a crime but who are present during a raid. In one scene, the director of ICE’s New York field office repeatedly asks his agents “how many targets” they’ve accumulated that day; following that, he calls an ICE agent and says, “Bring at least two people in—I don’t care what you do.” The boss repeatedly asks “how many targets” have been accumulated that day, and after that, he calls an ICE agent and says, “Bring at least two people in—I don’t care what you do.” Agents apprehend a “collateral” from Guatemala, who is seen crying over the phone to a loved one. “I left my country because my father was murdered,” the young man says through tears. “I don’t know what the problem was, but they told me if I didn’t leave the country they would also kill me. And this is still the case. I know that they will kill me as soon as I arrive.” Some of the female and Hispanic agents appear conflicted about the inhumanity of their jobs, and express frustration with the arrest of “collaterals.” “Luckily for us, we haven’t really been involved in any of that family-separation thing. We don’t rip children out of families’ arms and things like that. That’s just not what we do,” says one female ICE agent in New York City. What follows is perhaps Immigration Nation’s most harrowing sequence, where that same officer separates a New Yorker named Geronimo from his crying baby daughter. For other agents, it is all a game—and these people who have been fought like hell to get to America just numbers. “There’s 45,000 beds in the United States, and in this field office we have about 4,000,” offers an ICE agent in Atlanta. “We plan on keeping every one of them full. We’re gonna fill our beds, for sure. We’re gonna do everything we can.” Meanwhile Bob, an ICE assistant field office director in Charlotte, chuckles to his cop-pals about arresting immigrants who admit to him that they’ve crossed the border; later on, he laments the fact that his office only collected 70 people. “I wanted 100,” he says. Then there is ICE public affairs director Bryan Cox, who runs through a list of talking points—including that “91 percent of the detainees are criminals”—only to be corrected by an ICE agent who says that it’s more like 35 percent at their office. “Oh yeah, that’s fine,” Cox replies. “Just own it.” Immigration Nation transports viewers inside  detention centers and ICE field offices across the country, and even into Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. But it’s the stories of the victims, torn from their children and parents, that prove the most haunting. “When I was at ICE, they told me that they were going to separate us forever. She was going to stay here. I don’t know in whose hands,” cries Erin Ramos, a detained young father. “My daughter was crying, ‘Papi, don’t go! Papi, don’t leave! Stay with me. Papi, come with me. Papi. Don’t leave me alone.’ Crying. ‘And me as well, my love.’ ICE took her from right in front of me, leaving me with pain in my soul, because I’ve never been apart from her.” Johana, whose young son was separated from her and detained for forty days in a detention center, recounts how it affected him. “He came out very strange,” she says. “When I saw him for the first time, like this. He just breathed. He didn’t speak to me at all…for a long time. Then he spoke to me. He was nervous. He was taught some things…by force…because he did not know how to use the bathroom. When he asks for things, he raises his hands. At night, sometimes at night, he wakes up crying, like he is afraid.” While ICE was quite active under the Bush and Obama administrations, the agents and film make clear that things have been rapidly accelerated in the Trump era. In addition to ICE agents seizing non-violent offenders and “collaterals,” the Trump administration instituted “production quotas” for immigration judges, who are controlled by the Trump administration’s Department of Justice. If judges do not handle enough cases, they find themselves in the “red” and are dismissed. Pictures of money bearing Trump’s face and hats reading “Fake News” are strewn about ICE offices. And prior to the Trump administration asylum seekers who presented themselves at the border were immediately processed; now, it can take years in a detention center before you hear anything. An ICE raid in Immigration Nation Such is the case with Berta, a 63-year-old grandmother who legally entered the U.S. with her granddaughter, Yariela. The two fled to America after a member of MS-13 attempted to forcibly marry Yariela at the age of 12, and threatened to set Berta on fire if she did not allow it. So they traveled for ten days until they reached Texas and turned themselves in at the port of entry, seeking asylum. Yariela was released to her mother in Houston; Berta was detained, and has been imprisoned in ICE’s El Paso Detention Center for 17 months, awaiting processing. We spend some time with Berta, who is fearful for her life, until suddenly, she’s deported back to El Salvador at 3 a.m., and without informing her attorney. “The only thing I can say is that nobody can know she is back,” Berta’s friend warns her attorney. “Gang members are always asking about her.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

    "[] Since Joe Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president in April, the Trump campaign has spent $72 million in television advertising attacking the former vice president, with ads that veered rapidly on topics ranging from China to Biden’s age to policing policies. None significantly slowed Biden’s rising poll numbers. On Tuesday, the messaging behemoth that has been the Trump campaign ground to a halt, as it temporarily suspended all television advertising nationwide in order to review its strategy under its new campaign manager, Bill Stepien. While the pause will likely be short-lived — in a tweet Friday afternoon, the president said that they would be launching “a new ad campaign” Monday — the sudden decision is yet another sign that the campaign is reckoning with a yawning deficit in battleground state polling and an inability to find a defining message against Biden. President Donald Trump on Friday made the decision to resume television ads Monday after a phone conversation with Stepien and Jason Miller, a senior strategist on the campaign, to discuss their review. The first ad, seeking to define Biden as both a failure and a tool of the extreme left, was part of a national ad buy. But a campaign official said the next round of advertising would focus specifically on states that begin voting early. However brief, such a halt is unusual within the final 100 days of a presidential election, though it is unlikely that the six-day pause will have a significant effect one way or another on the Trump campaign’s ability to persuade voters come November. And the campaign sought to downplay its significance, tying it to the arrival of Stepien, who took over from Brad Parscale earlier in July. Campaign officials noted that in 2016, Trump had not run a single television ad at this point in the race. But Trump’s first campaign was a shoestring operation, with little staff and minimal funds, while his 2020 team is sprawling, with $295 million in cash on hand and more than 1,500 staff members in the field. Indeed, the pause is noteworthy given the size of Trump’s advertising effort till now: Since last January, the campaign has spent $202 million in television and digital advertising, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm. Biden, by comparison, has spent about $95 million over the same period. If anything, Trump’s advertising spending has only increased recently: Since early July his campaign has spent over $30 million on television and digital ads. Many of those ads sought to sow fear and division about the racial justice protests around the country, and several falsely stated Biden was in favor of defunding the police (he has stated repeatedly that he is not). The Trump campaign has been equally abundant in battleground states, spending $61 million since April across 11 states. It has also begun advertising in states that were previously considered safe for Democrats, like Minnesota, though it also has completely stopped advertising in Michigan. And even as the Trump campaign claims it is reassessing its messaging strategy, it uploaded a new ad to YouTube on Friday morning reiterating many of the messages it has been airing all spring and summer. Meanwhile, Trump’s main super PAC, America First Action, remains on the airwaves in four states, with $5 million reserved in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Arizona this week and next week. On Friday, the PAC added $860,000 to its buys in Pennsylvania and Arizona, according to Advertising Analytics. A second group, Restoration PAC, began a $2.5 million two-week buy in Michigan this week. The goal of the pause, officials said, was for Stepien to take a look at what television shows the campaign was advertising on and what time of day those ads were running, and then decide whether to tweak the mix to make sure the advertisements were reaching the right voters. Trump campaign officials have become concerned about when to spend the bulk of their money — they don’t want to run out, but they don’t want to be left with more than they need after mid-October, when much of early voting is already completed. One Republican consultant close to the campaign said the best window for spending was right after the convention, when it would be in a place to go up and never have to come back down. Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, still signs off on every large advertising expenditure, as he did when Parscale ran the campaign. Kushner, a White House official said, agreed with the temporary pause, arguing that it was beneficial to the president to have fresh eyes looking at spending decisions. Some former Trump officials said it was a good move to step back in the middle of the summer, when there was still plenty of time to readjust. “Considering the curveball COVID threw into the political landscape, it’s smart of the campaign to reassess what the most effective messaging is and where and when to place their ad dollars,” said Sean Spicer, the former White House press secretary who ran communications for the Republican National Committee in 2016. But other Republican observers questioned the wisdom of going dark so close to the election. “It’s too early to determine what impact the cancellation of TV has on the Trump campaign, but any time your opponent is running ads with no retaliation it can have significant impact,” said Sig Rogich, a Republican strategist from Nevada who worked on George H.W. Bush’s campaigns and advised Sen. John McCain during his 2008 presidential bid. He recalled a moment in the 1988 presidential race when the Bush team spent an entire week between conventions as the only campaign on air, helping to erase the lead of his opponent, Michael Dukakis. But that was also before digital advertising became a major arm of a campaign’s messaging strategy, and the Trump campaign is still pouring millions into digital ads each day. It has dozens of active ads on Facebook, serving as both fundraising ads and caustic attacks against Biden. Over the past week, the Trump campaign spent nearly $4.8 million on the platform — $575,000 on Wednesday alone, the most recent day for which spending data is available. Still, overall, the Trump campaign’s hundreds of millions in advertisements have sometimes seemed more of a show of force than a targeted buy. The campaign spent $10 million on two ads during the Super Bowl last year, and over $30 million has gone toward national advertising, a tactic criticized by some operatives as wasteful because it’s paying for time in safe states rather than targeted buys in battlegrounds. Some observers also said Trump missed an opportunity to take advantage of his incumbency and negatively define Biden as he was emerging from the primaries. When former President Barack Obama spent millions on ads attacking Mitt Romney during the summer of 2012, his messaging was disciplined. The Trump campaign has not had a similar focus. “It’s not just that the Trump campaign is behind, it’s that they’ve blown this historic opportunity to define an opponent, and its extraordinary,” said Stuart Stevens, a Republican strategist and former senior adviser for Romney’s campaign. “They basically had the field to themselves, and they still couldn’t score.” And now the Biden campaign is moving to close the gap. As Trump’s campaign goes off the air, the Biden campaign has made its biggest buys yet, targeting older voters in Nevada, Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin with an ad on Trump’s response to the coronavirus. Biden has spent $21 million on television last week and this week, according to data from Advertising Analytics, with the biggest share, $3.3 million, going to Florida. Still, since taking over as campaign manager, Stepien has tried to project confidence about the president’s chances in November. “We only need to win either Wisconsin or Michigan or Pennsylvania to win this thing again,” Stepien told reporters last week. Stepien said he still saw the pickup opportunities in New Hampshire and Minnesota that he had hoped for before the pandemic shifted the race. And though it has temporarily paused its advertising, the Trump campaign still has more than $146 million in television and radio ads booked through November, a number that far outpaces the Biden campaign’s. None of those reservations have been altered or shifted yet as part of the current review. This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2020 The New York Times Company",
    "[] Progressives are trying to take down another Democratic House incumbent in a primary this week — Missouri Rep. Lacy Clay— but the effort by the left has set off another clash with the Congressional Black Caucus. Some of the biggest names on the left are rallying around Cori Bush, a registered nurse and Black Lives Matter activist who is making her second run against Clay, a 10-term incumbent whose family has represented the St. Louis-based House seat since the late ’60s. The attempt to oust Clay has infuriated his allies in Congress — especially in the CBC, which his father, then-Rep. Bill Clay, co-founded. After watching a handful of their urban white colleagues defeated in recent years, senior Black Democrats have aggressively fought back against progressives who they say unfairly challenge members of their caucus. Tuesday's contest is one of the last chances for the left to grow their ranks before the end of the 2020 primary season. Slow ballot-counting initially obscured the size of their wins in New York’s June primaries, but the weeks followed brought three huge gains for progressives. Their preferred candidates ousted veteran Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) from his Bronx district and captured open seats in New York City and its suburbs — wins that sent a surge of energy to Missouri. “It was kind of like, ‘OK they won. So, OK, maybe we can get another one,’” Bush said in an interview. “People just automatically started paying attention to us. We had an uptick in fundraising, an uptick in volunteers and more media. That was a great boost to our campaign in these last final weeks.” Clay and his allies feel confident of victory, particularly because he dispatched Bush by a 20-point margin last cycle. But Bush’s operation is now better funded, more organized and has a formidable coalition of supporters. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is intimately involved in the race, helping Bush, a 2020 surrogate for his presidential campaign, with fundraising and joining her for livestream events. Meanwhile, Justice Democrats, the organization which helped propel now-Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to victory, and Fight Corporate Monopolies, a new outside group formed by Sanders allies, are airing TV ads on her behalf. Bush had raised nearly $570,000, compared to Clay’s $744,000 by mid-July. The incumbent went into the final few weeks with three times more cash-on-hand — but Bush and her allies have outspent Clay on the airwaves by at least $250,000, according to data from the ad-tracking firm Advertising Analytics. The race represents one of the final battles this cycle between progressives and the CBC, which rallied forcefully behind Reps. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) and Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.). Both won handily, but the caucus is eager to run the table in St. Louis and ward off challenges in future cycles. Some CBC members were “quite unhappy” over Sanders’ “political trespassing by endorsing [Clay’s] opponent,” said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, the only other Democrat in Missouri's delegation and a former CBC chair. Adding to their consternation is the fact that the congressman has signed on to co-sponsor bills on two top liberal issues: Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. “Lacy Clay is no moderate Democrat,” Cleaver said. But Bush and her allies say Clay is an absent politician. Progressives have leveled a litany of accusations against the congressman: that he sided against then-President Barack Obama’s attempt to shield retirement savings from greedy Wall Street financiers, that he is beholden to corporate PACs, and that he hasn’t been a forceful enough advocate for working families. Bush, her endorsers say, is uniquely suited for the moment. “Cori has lived through the reality of being a Black woman in this country,” said Jamaal Bowman, the middle-school principal who beat Engel, the House Foreign Affairs chair, in June. Justice Democrats is also in Bush’s corner for round two. “With the Black Lives Matter movement sweeping the entire nation, it would be fitting for one of the main leaders of the Ferguson movement to be elected to Congress,” Justice Democrats executive director Alex Rojas said in a statement. “There’s a new generation of leaders shaped by this movement who want to bring the urgency on the streets into elected office.” Despite the liberal group’s involvement, Ocasio-Cortez herself has not backed Bush this time. Last cycle, Ocasio-Cortez campaigned alongside Bush in St. Louis in the weeks after she ousted then-Rep. Joe Crowley. This time, she's noticeably absent, a likely sign of the uncomfortable politics around challenging an incumbent. (Ocasio-Cortez and Clay serve on a committee together.) Meanwhile, Clay is taking the challenge seriously. He’s dropped negative mailers and one heated\nattack ad\nthat said Bush profits off politics like President Donald Trump and that she claims to be \"the pastor of a church that doesn’t exist.” Clay’s campaign declined to make him available for an interview. But in a statement to POLITICO, he cast the election as “a simple choice” between his opponent’s “empty rhetoric” and his “real results.” “She claims to be a Democratic Socialist,” he wrote in the statement. “But when it comes to pocketing campaign contributions, she’s a crony capitalist to the max. A real progressive wouldn’t take campaign money and put it in her own pocket.” Clay touted his endorsements from Democratic groups, including Planned Parenthood, the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the CBC. And he knocked Bush for paying herself more than $22,000 from her campaign accounts in the second quarter. (Bush has said she needed to draw a salary to support her and her family after pausing her nursing job to become a full-time candidate). To win, Bush will need high support among young people and white voters. She also needs to peel off some of Clay’s support in the Black community, particularly in St. Louis County, outside the city limits. She attributes her loss two years ago in part to a car accident that sidelined her in a key stretch of the election. This time she comes armed with higher name ID from both her 2018 run and her appearance in the popular Netflix documentary “Bringing Down the House,” which also featured Ocasio-Cortez. “When I’m knocking, people are saying, “Oh, hey, I saw you on Netflix! You’re in that documentary,’” she said. But the element of surprise that helped Ocasio-Cortez in 2018 is not something Bush can use to her advantage this year. The CBC readied its defenses immediately following the midterms. They’ve framed progressive challengers as outsiders coming into a district to target longstanding members that have spent years ingrained in the community. Clay also has the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which rolled out a new policy at the beginning of the cycle to inhibit primary challenges against incumbents. “His constituents are not looking for an unknown, inexperienced person who touts left-leaning talking points as their representative. I think they want someone who can bring some stability,” said Rep. Anthony Brown (D-Md.), a CBC member. “I think a lot of people are anticipating a Biden administration, where relationships matter.” The CBC’s loyalty to incumbents extends beyond their own members. The caucus backed Engel over Bowman, though Bowman is Black. Bowman said in an interview that he wished he would have been considered for an endorsement, but that he did not take it personally. Bowman — one of three minority candidates to knock off a white Democratic incumbent in a city district over the past two years — described the growing primary challenges within the party as an “ideological one” rather than a “generational battle in Congress.” “I always considered it more of a healthy tension within the factions of the Democratic Party and within the factions of the Congressional Black Caucus,” Bowman said. “We need space for disagreement, debate and dialogue to create an America that works for everyone.” Bush views CBC’s support for incumbents differently, challenging the caucus to research the candidates before blindly endorsing. Black Caucus leaders need to more closely scrutinize their incumbents’ records “to see what this person has actually done for their district,” Bush said. “I don’t care that somebody’s name was on a membership of something,” she said. “That does not entitle them to hold the seat.”",
    "[] (Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration will announce measures shortly against “a broad array” of Chinese-owned software deemed to pose national-security risks, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said. The comments suggest a possible widening of U.S. measures beyond TikTok, the popular music-video app owned by ByteDance Ltd., one of China’s biggest tech companies. President Donald Trump told reporters Friday that he plans to ban TikTok from the U.S., but his decision hasn’t been announced. Pompeo signaled he expects a Trump announcement “shortly.” Chinese newspapers slammed a potential ban on TikTok. The president continues to weigh his options and may have an answer Monday or Tuesday, Fox Business reported on Sunday evening. Trump’s decision has implications for Microsoft Corp., which has been exploring an acquisition of the app from ByteDance. Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella spoke with Trump on Sunday to salvage the company’s effort to buy TikTok’s operations in the U.S. and several other countries. Microsoft Tries To Salvage Deal To Buy TikTok, Appease Trump Talks to buy the music video app would seek a resolution “in a matter of weeks” and look to be completed no later than Sept. 15, Microsoft said in a statement. The company will continue to engage Trump and the U.S. government, adding that “Microsoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the president’s concerns.” “If the company & data can be purchased & secured by a trusted U.S. company that would be a positive & acceptable outcome,” Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said on Twitter. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Trump confidant, tweeted that he understands the concerns of TikTok fans and users and that Microsoft taking over would be a “win-win.” Senators John Cornyn of Texas and Roger Wicker of Mississippi made similar comments, although Wicker also urged “tight security measures” to protect consumer data. Chinese software companies doing business in the U.S. are feeding data directly to Chinese authorities “whether it’s TikTok or WeChat -- there are countless more,” Pompeo, on of the Trump administraton’s China hawks, said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” Trump “will take action in the coming days with respect to a broad array of national-security risks that are presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist Party,” Pompeo said. Trump can either “force a sale” of TikTok or block the app by executive order, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on ABC’s “This Week,” adding that he wouldn’t discuss specifics on his talks with the president on the topic. CFIUS Objections Mnuchin, who heads the Committee on Foreign Investment on the United States, or CFIUS, said “the entire committee agrees that TikTok cannot stay in the current format because it risks sending back information on 100 million Americans.” That view that “there has to be a change “ is shared by lawmakers including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, Mnuchin said. TikTok has become one of the world’s most popular apps. It’s been downloaded more than 2 billion times globally and more than 165 million times in the U.S. ByteDance is prepared to sell 100% of TikTok’s U.S. operations as a way to head off a ban by Trump, two people with knowledge of the situation said earlier. TikTok has hired almost 1,000 people in the U.S. this year and will be employing another 10,000 into “great paying jobs” in the U.S., a company spokeswoman said in a statement. The business’s $1 billion creator fund also supports people in the country who are building livelihoods from the platform, she added. “TikTok U.S. user data is stored in the U.S., with strict controls on employee access,” she said. “TikTok’s biggest investors come from the U.S. We are committed to protecting our users’ privacy and safety.” Chinese state media defended TikTok, characterizing the Trump administration’s antagonism toward the company in a similar fashion to U.S. politicians’ attitude toward the Chinese global networking giant Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. The China Daily wrote in an editorial on Sunday that “although the Oval Office claims to oppose authoritarianism, it has a penchant for arbitrarily demonstrating its own authority.” And an editorial in the Global Times, one of China’s most combative state-run papers, said that “the U.S. claim that TikTok threatens its own national security is purely hypothetical and unwarranted charge -- just like the groundless accusation that Huawei gathers intelligence for the Chinese government.” (Updates with Microsoft statement from fourth paragraph) For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com Subscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

    "[] TikTok’s days in US app stores could be numbered. What once seemed extremely unlikely — that the Trump Administration would take the unprecedented step of actually banning the app — suddenly looks a lot more possible. After weeks of threats, Trump is forcing the issue. He has given the company a little more than a month to make things official with Microsoft (or another American buyer, should one emerge). If they don’t, he says TikTok will have to “close down” in the US. And, any deal should ensure that “the Treasury of the United States gets a lot of money,” according to Trump. Microsoft says it agrees.  Government coffers aside, Trump’s fixation on TikTok may seem bizarre, especially at a time when the United States is in the midst of a deadly pandemic that has killed thousands and cratered the economy. But TikTok’s days as a non-American app have been numbered for a while. It’s not just Trump, either. Even before his recent announcements, suspicion of TikTok has been a rare source of bipartisan agreement. The exact nature of those suspicions has been murky, though. Critics point out that, since parent company ByteDance is based in China, TikTok could be forced to hand over data to the Chinese government. TikTok has fought back against these claims. The company says it has an American CEO, and says it doesn’t take orders from China. It even hired an “army of lobbyists” to bolster these claims and convince officials TikTok isn’t really political. “In meetings with lawmakers, lobbyists insist that the app is mainly for entertainment and is not the type of content that is normally targeted for government surveillance,” the NYT reports. Officials have so far been unconvinced, and maybe rightfully so. Because while TikTok is known chiefly as a source of entertainment, the app has become more political, too. As TikTok’s popularity has skyrocketed in the US — it has 100 million US users, according to The Wall Street Journal —  its influence has grown. It’s that influence, and the technology that turned the Chinese app into a formidable competitor to its much larger social media counterparts, that has caused so much concern. At the heart of these concerns is TikTok’s algorithm, which drives the bulk of the app’s engagement and plays an outsize role in what goes viral on its platform. It’s also one of the key features that sets TikTok apart from other social apps — and what makes it so addictive. The app defaults to the algorithmically-generated “For You” feed, which serves up an endless stream of videos based on your interests and prior activity. But unlike Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, where users’ main feeds are driven by accounts they already follow, For You is separate from your existing subscriptions. Some critics have pointed to this algorithm as a potential danger in allowing a foreign-owned app to have so much influence. If the Chinese government can compel companies to participate in state-sponsored surveillance, then perhaps they could influence TikTok to meddle in US affairs more directly, the thinking goes. TikTok has recently taken steps to demystify its algorithm, and has promised to allow experts to examine it. But users would be hard-pressed to predict what kinds of videos will show up in their feeds at any given moment. And some informal tests have shown TikTok can be just as susceptible to filter bubbles as other platforms. Just as Facebook has been accused of manipulating its News Feed algorithm to favor one side of the political divide, some critics say TikTok could also use its algorithm to steer debate or sow division. “TikTok’s algorithm, unmoored from the constraints of your social network or professional content creators, is free to promote whatever videos it likes, without anyone knowing the difference,” analyst Ben Thompson recently wrote. “TikTok could promote a particular candidate or a particular issue in a particular geography, without anyone — except perhaps the candidate, now indebted to a Chinese company — knowing.” That may sound alarmist, even conspiratorial. But TikTok does have a troubling history of taking a heavy-handed approach to moderation. The app at one point had rules barring some types of “political” content from its recommendations, according to leaked guidelines. Documents obtained The Guardian last year suggest the app has used its content rules to advance “Chinese foreign policy aims.” And the company at one point encouraged moderators not to recommend “highly controversial” content, and both Barack Obama and Donald Trump appeared on a list of banned “foreign leaders or sensitive figures,” according to The Guardian. TikTok later acknowledged its “this was not the correct approach,” and that its policies had evolved. Despite all the furor, there’s been little direct evidence to back up claims that TikTok is a national security threat, or that the app “spies” on its users. Well, at least not more than other data-hungry social media apps. Some have pointed to a recent incident, when TikTok was caught “snooping” on users’ clipboards, but even this was hardly definitive. And TikTok was far from the only app grabbing this kind of data, which the company said it used for anti-spam purposes. Still, the 2016 election proved that easily-manipulated algorithms can be quite powerful. So it’s not surprising that some are spooked. Some TikTok fans suspect it’s more personal for Trump. After all, it was TikTok users who gleefully claimed credit for lackluster turnout at a June campaign rally after a series of viral videos encouraged users to register even though they had no intention of attending. More recently, Trump’s threats to ban TikTok incensed the app’s users so much they undertook a new campaign to sink the Trump app’s rating in the App Store — apparently believing that tanking its rating could get it kicked out of Apple’s App Store. (It didn’t, but the results of the prank resulted in hundreds of one-star reviews.) So it should come as no surprise that TikTok users are in a frenzy, with some of the app’s more popular users looking for a Plan B — and rivals like Facebook and Snapchat are poised to swoop in. It’s still not exactly clear what Trump means when he says he intends to “close down” TikTok if a deal doesn’t come together. He has threatened to use an executive order, but there are other laws that could allow the government to force a sale. The demand that the Treasury get a cut of any acquisition, which has also angered China, is, at best, legally dubious. If TikTok’s influence does dissolve — either because of a ban or because the current uncertainty gives Facebok the leverage it needs to take over — it means the first real competitor to Facebook in years will have been neutralized. That’s more than a little ironic considering Facebook’s lack of competition has, after all, been another topic of concern among lawmakers. At the same time, officials have made it very clear that while they may want American tech giants to have more competition, they don’t want it to come from China. Forcing TikTok into American hands, then, might give them the opportunity to have it both ways. The real question will be not who ends up owning the app, but whether it can continue to thrive in another company’s hands.",
    "[] WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump took in $165 million for his reelection effort in the month of July, a sum that that surpasses what his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, raised during the same period. But a massive cash-on-hand advantage that once gave the Republican a significant competitive edge has largely been closed, with Biden and the Democratic Party reporting that they are just $6 million shy of the $300 million that the president and the Republican National Committee have banked. The money puts the two on a virtually even footing that will allow both to saturate the airwaves with advertising, fund get-out-the-vote efforts and mobilize supporters — even if it has to be done virtually in many cases due to the coronavirus. The sums also suggest that even in the midst of a pandemic that has curtailed conventional campaign activities, Trump has continued to spend at a vigorous pace while Biden has cut expenses and stockpiled cash. Trump's large haul was welcomed by his campaign, which had been bested in fundraising by Biden, the former vice president, over the past two months. His advisers said they didn't just beat Biden — they boasted that they've raised a staggering $1.1 billion this cycle. \"The president’s support continues to increase while Joe Biden just posted a down fundraising month from his basement,” campaign manager Bill Stepien said, referring to the basement studio where Biden has been attending many of his digital-only campaign events. Campaigns often tout small contributions from grassroots donors as a sign of enthusiasm and Biden's campaign is no exception. They claim support from ordinary people has swelled and point to an average online contribution of $34.77 as proof. Campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillion called it a “lights-out fundraising month” and said the money will help Democrats build support \"to defeat Donald Trump this fall and win the battle for the soul of our nation.” The fundraising totals include donations collected by each candidate, national political parties and a series of joint fundraising committees both contenders have set up in conjunction with their parties. These financial arrangements allow donors to contribute six-figure sums.",

    "[] OTTAWA — The potential sale of social-media platform TikTok to Microsoft is leaving Canada with a sense of deja vu. Experts say the country is once again being pressured to take sides in a debate about digital technology that seems driven more by politics than by policy. U.S. President Donald Trump is effectively forcing the sale of the Chinese-owned TikTok, citing national-security concerns over the user data and device access potentially available to China's government. Microsoft has emerged as a potential buyer for the popular video-sharing app, seeking to acquire its presence in the United States, New Zealand, Australia and Canada. Michael Geist, an expert in internet law at the University of Ottawa, says the issue feels like a replay of the debate over whether to allow Huawei technology into Canada's 5G wireless data networks. The federal government still hasn't ended that debate with a decision, while Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou awaits possible extradition to the United States after being arrested in Vancouver and two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, have been detained in China for more than 600 days. Geist says Canada is once again uncomfortably pressured to take sides in an emerging global digital tech battle and may try to not get too involved in the TikTok talks. \"At this stage, I'm not convinced that the Canadian government has clear policy on the area,\" Geist said, \"meaning our likely response is to stay on the sidelines and let the issue unfold without much input or engagement.\" TikTok launched three years ago and now boasts 100 million users worldwide who upload short, catchy videos. A report earlier this year from We Are Social, a global agency that tracks social-media use, found that TikTok was the sixth most-downloaded app in Canada in 2019, but used by only nine per cent of Canadian internet users aged 16 to 64. Trump has framed his concerns around a Chinese company having access to Americans' personal data, echoing concerns that earlier this year led a Chinese gaming company to sell Grindr, a gay dating app, to an American company for over US$600 million. Trump's push comes amid escalating rhetoric towards Beijing over trade and the novel coronavirus pandemic. \"The recent TikTok developments in the U.S. appear to be driven far more by politics than policy,\" Geist said. \"There is little difference in the data collection practices of TikTok and the large U.S. social-media companies.\" A decision late last month from the Court of Justice of the European Union highlighted what it saw as the inadequacy of U.S. privacy laws, saying the U.S. government could have unchecked access to user information through its own surveillance laws. So while bringing TikTok's user data to U.S. servers might alleviate concerns about Chinese spying, it doesn't eliminate concerns of U.S. agencies doing the same to an American-owned platform. \"When Europe passed the strongest privacy regulation in the world, Microsoft decided to offer those protections and rights to everyone — even though they weren't required to by law,\" said Lauren Reid, president of privacy consultancy The Privacy Pro. \"At the end of the day, Microsoft is a U.S. company and is subject to the U.S. government surveillance programs, which allow unchecked access to the personal information held by private companies.\" On Monday, Trump told reporters he would ban TikTok in the U.S. unless Microsoft or another American company bought the app by Sept. 15, with a portion of the sale going to the U.S. treasury. Christopher Parsons, a senior research associate at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, said Trump's actions to force a sale would be a fairly substantive break with the way governments ordinarily treat internet companies. In effect, the president's actions suggest that each country should have its own branches of social media companies, Parsons said. A question for Canadian policy-makers is what they would do if a country demanded part of a domestic tech darling — Parsons used Ottawa-based Shopify as an example — be hived off for similar reasons Trump has for TikTok. \"If Canada were to be involved, I think that it may be less around concerns about there being two TikToks ... and more around are these the kinds of norms we want to be propagated,\" he said. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 4, 2020. Jordan Press, The Canadian Press",
    "[] President Trump says he'll ride to the rescue of jobless Americans if Congress fails to act, telling reporters that he will soon sign an executive order restoring at least some of the extra unemployment benefits that expired at the end of July. For Democrats, it's kind of like having an uncle they barely know show up at a family reunion and expect a hug. They would look churlish if they complained about an increase in benefits, and yet having Trump provide it unilaterally would be wrong on a bunch of levels. As Trump should have learned from the impeachment proceedings, the president doesn't have the authority just to rewrite how Congress appropriates money. Here, he reportedly wants to finance the extra benefits by redirecting money Congress appropriated in the last big coronavirus relief bill that hasn't yet been spent. That law, however, provided no such authority. Beyond that, the problem isn't the lack of money for the extra benefits program, which provided an additional $600 per week. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act gave it an unlimited amount! But the language passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump ended the program as of July 31, full stop. The program's demise was written into the statute. Trump can't wave a wand and change that. According to Bloomberg, Trump told reporters that he also planned to order a payroll tax holiday. This idea is championed by conservative economist Stephen Moore, who insisted in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece that Trump had the authority to delay the collection of payroll taxes. The tax would still have to be paid in full, however, when the deferral ended. For a fundamentally solid business struggling with cash-flow problems caused by the pandemic, such a payroll tax holiday could be helpful if it lasted long enough. But if it were framed as a way to stimulate the economy by giving workers and businesses extra money, that would be dangerous. It's not extra money; it's just a loan. The only way it could be a true boost to the economy is if Congress made it a real holiday and suspended the tax, rather than simply delaying its collection. As with so many things, the root of the problem here is Congress' inability to strike deals on important issues. It has been obvious for weeks that the economy isn't going to quickly rebound to its previous heights after the recession caused by the pandemic. But the Republican-controlled Senate sat on a House-passed sequel to the CARES Act, evidently waiting for the miraculous economic rebound that never came. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) finally offered a counterproposal late in July, calling for about $200 per week in added unemployment benefits — after the $600 add-on had already stopped in many states. Now the White House and congressional Democrats are struggling to close the yawning gap between the two sides, with McConnell reportedly confining himself to the sidelines. (Trump has offered a short-term deal to extend unemployment benefits and a moratorium on evictions from apartments financed by federally backed mortgages, but Democrats don't want to lift the pressure on the president to bargain on other vital issues, including aid to revenue-starved state and local governments and support for state election systems.) Granted, some of Trump's executive actions have come after Congress has refused to do things his way, as on the issue of the southern border wall. But even there, Congress could have defanged the issue of illegal immigration and obviated the need for Trump's unilateralism had it managed to overhaul the broken U.S. immigration system. Instead, lawmakers have all but thrown up their hands. It's worth noting that Trump is surfing on a wave of presidential power grabs that picked up momentum under Presidents Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama as partisan divisions in Congress deepened and lawmakers' willingness to compromise faded. Although a new study by the American Action Forum has found that Trump has been issuing executive orders and memorandums at a faster pace than any of those presidents, the difference isn't dramatic — instead, it's been a pretty consistent escalation. Democrats who didn't complain about Obama's use of executive power because they liked the results — for example, when his administration defied some of the deadlines written into the Affordable Care Act — find themselves in an uncomfortable position now as Trump prepares to help millions of jobless Americans who've lost their extra benefits. But you can count on Trump to give Democrats another reason to complain. If he does issue an order extending benefits, he'll probably provide a lot less than $600 per week.",
    "[] Maybe this will turn out to be one of those “darkest before the dawn” moments, but as Trump administration officials and Democratic leaders working on the next coronavirus relief package entered what was expected to be a lengthy negotiating session Thursday afternoon, the prospects of a deal looked dim at best. Democratic leaders and the Trump administration remain trillions of dollars apart in their proposals for the relief package, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters Wednesday, and the tone of the negotiators turned sharply more acrimonious on Thursday. Asked during a morning appearance on CNBC why she couldn’t reach across the aisle to “give a huge chunk of money to the people who are disenfranchised, to the minorities who want so badly to stay in business and can't,” Pelosi tore into Republicans: “Perhaps you mistook them for somebody who gives a damn, for what you just described. That's the problem,” she said. “See the thing is, they don't believe in governance. And that requires some acts of governance to do that.\" Pelosi had suggested Wednesday that there’s “light at the end of the tunnel” but the length of the tunnel remained to be seen, but she put a more ominous spin on that metaphor in a Thursday press briefing with reporters. \"The light at the end of the tunnel may be the freight train of the virus coming at us if we do not contain it,” she said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) blamed Democrats for blocking a short-term extension last week of the federal unemployment benefits but told CNBC that he thinks a deal will happen. “There is a desire on the part of both the Democrats and the Republicans — at least most of the Republicans, not every single one — that we get to an outcome because the economy does need an additional boost until we get the vaccine,” McConnell said. “Exactly when that deal comes together I couldn’t tell you, but I think it will at some point in the near future.” Pelosi takes a hard line: The speaker hasn’t budged off her insistence that she’s not interested in a short-term deal and that enhanced unemployment benefits of $600 a week should be renewed. Pelosi “remains almost entirely unyielding in her demands,” Politico says, and Democrats have been unified in their position. \"Why dismantle a program that almost all economists say is working and put something new in its place that will take months to go into effect?\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer asked Thursday. Trump again threatens to use executive orders: President Trump sure didn’t sound like he was expecting a deal to be reached. He said Thursday he was preparing to sign executive orders as soon as Friday aimed at addressing his priorities for coronavirus relief. “Upon departing the Oval Office for Ohio, I’ve notified my staff to continue working on an Executive Order with respect to Payroll Tax Cut, Eviction Protections, Unemployment Extensions, and Student Loan Repayment Options,” he tweeted. The threat of executive action was seen as the administration’s attempt to exert some leverage to get Democrats to move toward an agreement, and there are questions about whether the executive orders (aside from one on the eviction moratorium) would be legal. But in a sign that Trump might really move ahead with the orders, The Washington Post reports that the administration asked federal agencies to identify all unspent money from the $2 trillion Cares Act passed in March and that the White House was trying to determine whether that money could be redirected toward temporary unemployment benefits or the eviction moratorium. Pelosi on CNBC encouraged Trump to extend the eviction moratorium but added that legislative action to provide money for rental and housing assistance was still needed since a moratorium would be of limited use if people ultimately still can’t pay their bills. Others also remain concerned that executive orders would be too limited in scope to deliver the aid the economy needs. What’s next: The negotiators were meeting at 5 p.m. ET. But senators are headed home and Politico notes that many don’t expect to be back in the Capitol next week. The House, meanwhile, is out next week. “Both can be called back,” Politico says, “but when you send ’em home, it’s usually because action is far off.” A reminder of what’s at stake: Enhanced unemployment benefits for millions of Americans expired last week, and a moratorium on evictions also ended last month. The Paycheck Protection Program of small-business loans is set to expire on Saturday. Meanwhile, first-time claims of unemployment benefits have topped 1 million for 20 straight weeks (see more below). Many economists now expect the economy to suffer as households pull back on spending. “Talks between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and the two Democratic leaders have turned into a giant game of chicken even as millions of Americans face growing financial hardships and the U.S. economy continues to stumble along,” Politico reported Wednesday evening. Right now, it looks like there are no winners in this game. Like what you're reading? Sign up for our free newsletter.",
    "[] (Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump signed a pair of executive orders prohibiting U.S. residents from doing business with the Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat apps beginning 45 days from now, citing the national security risk of leaving Americans’ personal data exposed. The bans mark a significant escalation by Trump in his confrontation with Beijing as the U.S. seeks to curb China’s power in global technology. With the U.S. election less than 90 days away, Trump is making his challenge of China a central theme of his campaign, where he trails Democrat Joe Biden in the polls. Shares of WeChat’s owner, China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd., fell as much as 10% in morning trading and sliced almost $70 billion from its market value. The offshore yuan weakened as much as 0.45%, the most in two weeks. “This is yet another watershed moment in the U.S.-China technology cold war here where the U.S. government is targeting these two very popular Chinese apps and basically saying they have national security problems,” said Paul Triolo, Head of Global Technology policy at Eurasia Group. “It shows the depth of the U.S. concern.” The move coincides with Trump’s push for the sale of TikTok, the popular video app owned by ByteDance Ltd., to an American company. It threatens penalties on any U.S. resident or company that conducts transactions with TikTok, WeChat or their owners after the orders take effect. “To protect our Nation, I took action to address the threat posed by one mobile application, TikTok. Further action is needed to address a similar threat posed by another mobile application, WeChat,” Trump said in the order against WeChat, released minutes after the TikTok measure. While WeChat hasn’t been widely adopted in the U.S., the ban would still have broad implications because it’s used by more than a billion people and is central to business and social communications with China. The measure blocks all transactions involving WeChat but doesn’t amount to a broader ban on dealings with Tencent, according to a U.S. official. The order against TikTok blocks all transactions in which its owner, ByteDance, or subsidiaries have an interest, the official said. Earlier this week, Trump threatened to shut down TikTok if its owners didn’t sell the business to a U.S. company by Sept. 15. Microsoft Corp. has been in talks about a possible purchase of TikTok’s operations in the U.S., Australia, Canada and New Zealand. TikTok said in a blog post it is “shocked” by the order and will pursue all remedies available, including the U.S. courts. Tencent said it is reviewing the executive order to get a full understanding. China said Friday that the U.S. was putting “selfish interests above market principles and international rules” and engaging in “political manipulation and oppression.” “The relevant businesses follow market principles and international rules in conducting business operations in the U.S.,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily briefing in Beijing on Friday in response to a question about the bans. The measures would apply to any transaction over which the U.S. could have jurisdiction, and sanctions would be defined by the U.S. Commerce Secretary, according to a Trump administration official, who discussed the order on condition of anonymity. Trump’s executive order likely means WeChat gets bumped off Apple Inc. and Google’s app stores in 45 days. Transactions subject to punishment could include agreements to make TikTok or WeChat available in app stores and purchases of ads on the apps, according to a person familiar with the matter, who discussed the orders on condition of anonymity. Simply downloading the apps could be affected, since that involves accepting terms of service that include an intellectual property agreement between the user and app developer, the person said. WeChat, the messaging software developed by Tencent, has evolved into an all-purpose app that allows people to use it for payments, e-commerce and more. The app is one of the most popular in the world with more than 1 billion users, and U.S. companies like Starbucks Corp., for example, use the service with consumers in China. Tencent is one of China’s most valuable tech companies, and its Chief Executive Officer Pony Ma is among the many business leaders who serves as a delegate to the National People’s Congress, China’s rubber-stamp parliament. Tencent shares recovered to close about 5% lower, while the yuan pared losses to 0.24%. Trump made his move under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a 1977 law that allows the president to declare a national emergency in response to an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” allowing him to block transactions and seize assets. “IEEPA is an incredibly expansive authority and allows the president to declare a national emergency with respect to just about anything,” Brian Fleming, a lawyer at Miller & Chevalier in Washington who previously worked in the Justice Department’s national security division. In his TikTok order, Trump said the app “automatically captures vast swaths” of user data, including location information and browsing history. “This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information -- potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage,” Trump said. TikTok says American user data is stored in servers in the U.S. and Singapore, not China. But TikTok’s terms of service stipulate that the company may share information with its parent, subsidiary or other affiliates. Previous versions of its privacy policy warned users it could exchange information with its Chinese businesses, law enforcement agencies and public authorities, if legally required to do so. Banning WeChat in the U.S. could have far greater implications to cross-border business between Chinese and American companies, impacting everything from the manufacturing of medical face masks and Apple iPhones to the inking contracts of lawyers and bankers. In China, it’s virtually impossible to function without WeChat and is essentially used by businesses in the place of email and text messages, which are not used as widely in China as they are in the U.S. Other messaging apps like Facebook Inc.-owned WhatsApp are blocked in China, making it harder to communicate with overseas partners without WeChat. “A ban on WeChat would be consequential because it would practically shut down communication between the U.S. and China,” said Graham Webster, China Digital Economy Fellow at think tank New America. “There are real data, privacy, and security concerns but they go well beyond these two Chinese apps and these orders just wrap the real issues up in political theatre.” (Updates with TikTok response) For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com Subscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source. ©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "[] 中美科技戰不斷升級，美國國務卿蓬佩奧在當地時間周三舉行記者會宣布，將擴大「清潔網絡」（Clean Network）行動，以保障美國人的私隱安全，今次針對5個領域，包括電訊營運商、應用程式商店、手機應用程式（Apps）、雲端儲存服務及光纖電纜。該行動要求把中國手機Apps從美國市場下架、吊銷中資電訊商在美國的營運牌照、限制中資雲端服務供應商收集數據的能力等。 中國外交部表示，堅決反對美國企圖封殺中國應用程式的行為，有關做法根本沒有任何事實依據，完全是惡意抹黑和政治操弄，敦促美方糾正錯誤做法，還世界一個自由、開放、安全的網絡空間。 點名WeChat損數據安全 蓬佩奧指出，美國要確保中國電訊商不會與美國電訊網絡連接起來，以免對國家安全構成威脅，因此促請美國監管機構取消中國電信（00728）及其他3間中資電訊商的營業許可。他又指TikTok及WeChat（微信海外版）等中國Apps危害美國國民的數據安全，要求美國的應用程式商店把來自中國不可靠的Apps下架，亦會禁止華為及其他手機製造商預載美國的Apps，以保護當地的個人和商業資訊不會被中國利用或盜竊。他說：「由於母公司設在中國，TikTok、WeChat等程式對美國公民個人資料有顯著威脅，更遑論被中共用作內容審查工具。我們不想美國公司做華為侵犯人權的共犯，或成為中共監控工具一部分。」蓬佩奧促請其他國家與美國合作。 限制雲端儲存 禁鋪海纜 同時，美國將限制中國雲端服務商的能力，防止阿里（09988）、百度、中移動（00941）、中電信及騰訊（00700）等控制的雲端供應商，接觸、收集、儲存及處理與美國有關的敏感資料，包括新冠疫苗的研究。同時，不容中國透過海底光纖電纜，獲取美國與全球的互聯網資訊，不再允許華為海洋網絡公司鋪設海底電纜。 在中國，外交部發言人汪文斌強調，許多目前被美單邊制裁的中國企業都是無辜，其技術和產品也安全，從未發生過一件類似「斯諾登事件」、「維基解密」的網絡安全事件，亦沒有類似「棱鏡門計劃」、「方程式組織」及「梯隊系統」的網絡監聽監視行為。 外交部斥滿身污跡竟談清潔 他直斥美國的做法是維護自身的高科技壟斷地位，完全違背市場原則和國際經貿規則，嚴重威脅全球產業鏈供應鏈安全，是典型的霸道行徑，「美國自身滿身污跡，卻大談什麼清潔網絡，這純屬荒謬可笑」。中國國務委員兼外交部長王毅周三接受新華社專訪時亦批評，美國無資格打造什麼「清潔國家聯盟」，並形容其演繹了一場「教科書式的霸凌」。 對於美國限制中國電訊商、應用程式及雲端等5個領域在美國營運，香港資訊科技商會榮譽會長方保僑認為，限制的範圍比之前更大，牽連更廣，除了影響港人的通訊及日常生活，也阻礙香港的科研發展。如果中國的電訊商無法在美國落地，既影響國際服務，漫遊費用也隨之增加。很多中國的電訊商本身同時在香港營運，亦有可能影響通訊安排，包括接駁美國的服務會中斷。至於Apps方面，方保僑指一些即時通訊程式在中國及美國分別被禁，要順暢地聯絡三地，需另覓一個三地甚至更多地方也能使用的平台。 中大商學院高級講師李兆波相信，美國針對中國網絡軟件及硬件，屬中美貿易戰的延續，是次行動是美國保護本土市場，故阻止中國科技企業在全球發展。雖然對香港經濟沒有直接影響，但美國與香港貿易頻繁，日後香港企業應用雲端時，要考慮選用中國或美國服務，以免資料放錯地方，誤中政治地雷。此外，中美兩國不同網絡，企業或需增加調整成本。",

    "[] President Donald Trump asserted on Monday that a force other than foreign adversaries was interfering in U.S. elections: Democrats. “I’ll tell you who was meddling in our elections,” the president said at a White House news briefing. “The Democrats are meddling by wanting and insisting on sending mail-in ballots when there’s corruption all over the place.” Trump had just rebuffed a question on whether he had confronted President Vladimir Putin of Russia on reported efforts to meddle in U.S. elections. Instead, he said Democrats were playing unfairly by pushing for more mail-in ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump has repeatedly lambasted Democrats for advocating mail-in voting, claiming with no evidence that it is a ploy to help them win the election by opening the doors to voter fraud. But Trump struck a new tone Monday in equating Democrats to authoritarian governments actively trying to undermine American democratic institutions. The president’s remark come after the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, Bill Evanina, said publicly that Russia was vying to sway the election in Trump’s favor and that China and Iran were hoping for a Joe Biden victory. Russian interference has always been a sore spot for Trump, who has denied reports by his own intelligence officials that Moscow interfered in the 2016 elections. He has dismissed the claims as a “witch hunt,” particularly suggestions that those efforts could have been tied to his campaign. Democrats have been pushing for a shift to mail-in voting, fearing that polling places could become hotbeds for spreading the coronavirus. Despite Trump’s protestations, there is little evidence that mail-in voting allows more fraud than in-person voting, and a handful of states already conduct elections entirely by mail. Still, several state leaders and Democrats expressed concerns about the U.S. Postal Service’s ability to handle a national election as the new Trump-appointed postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, makes cuts in the service in the name of reducing costs. Postal workers have complained about increased delays amid DeJoy’s changes, and voters are being encouraged to send in their ballots as soon as they can.",

    "[] Ruben J. Gonzales, vice president of the Victory Institute, and his colleagues have a favorite cautionary saying: “If you’re not at the table, you might be on the menu.” Whoever forms the next administration, the Victory Institute—sister organization of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, which supports LGBTQ candidates running for office—would like that administration to appoint for the first time an out LGBTQ Supreme Court justice, the first Senate-confirmed LGBTQ Cabinet member, and the first ambassadors who are LGBTQ women, LGBTQ people of color, and transgender. Revealing its Presidential Appointments Initiative exclusively to The Daily Beast, the institute said it would also like the administration to “ensure LGBTQ presidential appointees are equal to or exceed our percentage in the U.S. population.” The Powerful Gay Meaning of Pete Buttigieg’s Presidential Run “We know that having LGBTQ people at the decision-making tables influences the policies put forward and ensures the LGBTQ community is understood firsthand,” said Gonzales. “That was reflected in the Obama administration’s guidance on protecting trans students under Title IX [revoked by current Education Secretary Betsy DeVos]. Even the most valuable allies we have may not know those experiences—around dealing with teachers, gym class, the nurse’s office. Some of those nuances we get from having LGBTQ voices at the table.” Gonzales emphasized the campaign is not about tokenism or mere numbers. “It is important that these LGBTQ appointees are qualified. People who object to what we are calling for always say ‘it doesn’t matter’ if a person is LGBTQ, just that they are qualified. Yes, they should be, but LGBTQ people—our lives and experiences—should also be represented at these decision-making tables.” Ruben J. Gonzales. The first of the institute’s appointment initiatives was launched during the Clinton administration; of the Obama administration’s record-breaking 330 out-LGBTQ appointees, 158 were assisted by the institute. Raffi Freedman-Gurspan, the first out-trans person to work as a permanent White House staffer, told The Daily Beast she did not realize her appointment as outreach and recruitment director on President Obama’s staff would “make the headlines around the world that it did.” She eventually became Obama’s primary LGBT liaison. “I literally walked into the office, I kid you not, and saw myself on CNN and MSNBC announcing my appointment throughout the day,” she recalled to The Daily Beast. “It was a little bit of a shock, but I absolutely appreciated that this was a step forward for our community, particularly for trans women and trans women of color. I was also ready to just do my job as part of a brilliant team.” James C. Hormel, who was the United States’ first out-gay ambassador—appointed by Bill Clinton to Luxembourg in 1999—told The Daily Beast he was “very aware” of making history because of the efforts made by the Senate to scupper his nomination. “We had the votes, and we tried to get a vote for two years,” Hormel recalled. “But Trent Lott, then the Senate majority leader, wouldn’t bring it up, he absolutely refused. Finally, it was done as a recess appointment. Through the course of it all, I learned a great deal about how things worked and didn’t work in Washington, and international relations.” James Hormel. The homophobia Hormel faced, he said, “was ridiculous. The accusations were absurd. There was a definite ‘religion’ aspect to it. It was said out loud, ‘How can you send a gay man to represent us in a Roman Catholic country like Luxembourg?’ Meanwhile, Luxembourg had already approved the nomination and they were offended because they didn’t have an ambassador. They weren’t offended by me. They were offended by the process.” Hormel said “the most ridiculous” charge was leveled by then-Arkansas Republican Sen. Tim Hutchinson, “who was one of three people who put a hold on my nomination. He asked me, ‘Would you disavow [famous nun drag troupe] the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence?’ I replied, ‘I never avowed them.’ He said, ‘Well, you’re on a videotape laughing at them.’ I said, ‘Well, they were funny.’ It was one silly thing after another.” Eric Fanning, former Army secretary (2016-17), was the first openly gay head of any service in the U.S. military. He had served in the Pentagon in both the Clinton and Obama administrations and “moved up the ladder, rung by rung,” he told The Daily Beast. The Victory Institute’s presidential appointments project helped connect him to his landmark post. His sexuality first made news during the confirmation process for his role as undersecretary of the Air Force. “When I got the Army nod, I was more prepared, but it still got more attention than you expect or are fully prepared for,” he said. “I joke my name went from ‘Eric Fanning’ to ‘Gay Man’ during those transitions because that would be the headline. The difference was, with the Air Force appointment you would get to my name in the third paragraph. With the Army post it was in the first.” Fanning hoped that the news might be “of value to someone to see ceilings broken, and provide inspiration for others who see they themselves in a job of leadership and, through me, know there is a path for them.” Four years ago, The Daily Beast understands that the then-Hillary Clinton presidential campaign reached out to Fanning to inform him he was on the shortlist of five possible defense secretary picks. (Fanning would not comment on this to The Daily Beast.) Now, he said, the number of LGBTQ people who would excel in such roles has “exploded. There is no dearth of LGBTQ candidates. We had one running for president [Pete Buttigieg] rather successfully.” Ann Mei Chang. “The government serves the people, and so should represent the full diversity of American people—and that includes LGBTQ Americans,” Ann Mei Chang, chief innovation officer of USAID from 2014 to 2017, told The Daily Beast. “If we don’t have people making the decisions, setting policies, coming from all walks of life, then it is hard for the government to truly represent the people.” At USAID, Chang said she hoped she made a difference by being a role model for others “to see that it was possible to have a senior role in government as an out woman of color. I heard from younger staff that this was meaningful. It was incredible to show people something was possible that they may not have thought possible otherwise. We can’t underestimate how important it is to see people in roles who look like yourself, who come from backgrounds like yourself, and have experiences like yourself. It means those things might be possible for you.” In the Trump administration, Richard Grenell, the former ambassador to Germany, served as acting director of national intelligence from February to May—making him the first out-gay person to serve in a Cabinet-level position. Last month, via Twitter, Grenell accused the Victory Fund of anti-Republican bias (tagging in the IRS), which the fund denies. “We are a 527 political organization! We are NOT tax-exempt! We are non-partisan because we choose to be, not because we have to be,” the group responded. In the last 3 1/2 years, fewer than 10 LGBTQ people submitted their résumés to the Victory Institute, expressing an interest in working within the Trump administration. Nearly 100 people in the last month submitted résumés in the hope of a future Biden administration—reflecting, said Gonzales, the disparity many LGBTQ people see between where they see President Donald Trump standing on LGBTQ equality versus former Vice President Joe Biden. “We are non-partisan,” said Gonzales. “If there are LGBTQ people who support full equality who want to join the Trump administration, we will support them.” The importance of LGBTQ presidential appointees being “in the room” is made painfully apparent by the homophobia and transphobia of the Trump administration, Hormel claimed. “The current administration, regardless of the words they speak, are doing whatever they can to diminish the LGBTQ constituency, especially in respect of transgender people and those trans people serving in the military,” Hormel told The Daily Beast. “It’s outrageous to me, and I don’t think it would be happening if there were more LGBTQ people in positions of leadership.” “I thought, ‘This is a too important part of me to hide’” For Ann Mei Chang, picking the first LGBTQ woman, LGBTQ person of color, or trans person as an ambassador would be significant, as she recalled seeing the-then “eight or nine” white gay male ambassadors together at a State Department event. “It was a pretty shocking image. It didn’t represent the diversity of the LGBTQ community,” Chang said. “It’s important not only domestically that we represent the full diversity of the population but overseas too. It says something about what America is about. If ‘all LGBTQ people’ are white gay men, that’s a pretty limited view and offers a limited perspective. I’m as informed in my experience as an LGBTQ person as I am by being a woman and being Asian American.” The discrimination is echoed in many institutions, said Chang, in “the advantages white men have, which also exist for gay people as well.” The military was a particularly vexed arena for LGBTQ people—particularly as Eric Fanning built his career as “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” was both introduced and then repealed. “In many ways the military was dragged kicking and screaming into change, but in other ways one could argue the military led the way. ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ was repealed before marriage equality was won. But when I first served in the Obama administration and went back into the Pentagon and ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ still existed, it was really strange for me. It didn’t apply to me, obviously, but to have this piece of discriminatory legislation still around I thought I would have to leave if it wasn’t repealed. I think my appointment had more resonance because of it.” Then-acting U.S. Secretary of the Army Eric Fanning testifies during his confirmation hearing Jan. 21, 2016, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. His sexuality “wasn’t a big deal” at the Pentagon. “If anything, it exposed me to more support. It wasn’t part of either confirmation process. I had worked in national security for many years and two presidential administrations. I had my bona fides. People knew me. “I didn’t think how big a deal it was until I started hearing from people in uniform—some out, some thinking of coming out—that it had given them hope. Just because ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ was repealed does not mean everybody was suddenly out. Still today, a lot of people are serving in silence.” Fanning said he did not face any homophobia inside the job but did from commentators including Mike Huckabee and right-wing blogs. “The fact it was broadcast I was gay actually made life a lot easier. People think you have a coming out moment, but you are coming out all the time. One of the first questions in the military is, ‘Do you have a wife or partner?’” Fanning said many people were supportive, others “didn’t care, and there’s that group like the old guys in the Muppets balcony [the iconic Statler and Waldorf] who complain about everything. But I thought, why make such an important decision about your life, personal integrity, and being able to live your whole self because of a worst-case scenario of those people who I promise are outnumbered by people who will support you.” Indeed, at parties if Fanning brought a male friend, that person was “swarmed” by colleagues excitedly asking if he was a boyfriend. His now-husband, Ben Masri-Cohen, has also experienced this warmth. “I hadn’t anticipated the experience would be as positive as it was,” said Fanning. It was incredibly moving on his last day in office, he said, to be applauded out of the Pentagon with Masri-Cohen at his side. Margarethe Cammermeyer, the colonel who in 1994 successfully challenged the then-ban on lesbians and gay men serving in the military in a landmark court case, told Fanning that she had never met anyone who regretted coming out. It was seeing her story that inspired Fanning himself to come out, while serving in the Clinton administration. “I thought, ‘This is a too important part of me to hide.’ I didn’t think there was anyone else who was gay at the Pentagon back then, which is ridiculous. But I couldn’t see any openly LGBTQ people in the administration, I couldn’t see a career for me. I thought, ‘People like me don’t get promoted.’” Fanning left the Pentagon, worked for CBS News, and returned under President Barack Obama. There were, said James Hormel of his drawn-out ambassadorial appointment, “moments of depression and more moments of anger—and the anger and depression had to be tempered because they wouldn’t produce any result.” In retrospect, he said, “it was helpful to me because when I arrived in Luxembourg, the government was very sympathetic and really went out of their way to work with me. We had an excellent relationship.” In 1995, Hormel was proud to give a major speech at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva about HIV, AIDS, and human rights, “which was still an untouchable subject even then.” He also met delegates who could not be out in their countries of origin. “Looking back my service was important, and looking at what has happened since any service is important,” Hormel said. “Look at Kamala’s [Harris] reception, my god. We should be ashamed of ourselves it has taken so long [for a Black woman to be a VP pick]. She’s wonderful. I know her well, and I am in great awe and have great admiration for her. She deserves all the accolades that will come her way.” Raffi Freedman-Gurspan. Working in many government departments meant, said Raffi Freedman-Gurspan, that LGBTQ people and issues were brought up with regard to the Zika virus. “I was able to say, ‘A lot of this messaging is very heteronormative. Folks in our community get pregnant too.’ I could also talk to our advocates too about getting messaging out to the community.” Without the presence of LGBTQ appointees, would the Obama administration have advanced so far on LGBTQ issues? this reporter asked Freedman-Gurspan. “Simply put, no,” she said. “Our heterosexual and cisgender colleagues looked to us for guidance. It also fostered good community relations. Advocates couldn’t say the White House didn’t understand with me, and others, there. Part of my job was to have sometimes tough, delicate conversations with community groups about what we could and couldn’t deliver—and that could be difficult. But that’s part of a healthy relationship.” Fanning is “100 percent convinced” that it makes a difference if LGBTQ appointees are “in the room.” “I saw it in my own career. They will at least talk about the issues differently. I was in the room and not out, when the chiefs were talking about lifting the ban and introducing ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’ which was a terrible compromise. At the time it felt like it was about getting us halfway down the field when really it was setting us off in the completely wrong direction. “The ways they talked about gays and lesbians was startling to me—it was the most pejorative, stereotypical, and dismissive language. ‘This is immoral,’ ‘This is unacceptable,’ ‘This flies against the values of our country and the military and what we fight for.’ ‘My soldiers won’t stand for this.’ “There was a very conservative culture in the military. The chiefs at that time did not want to end the ban. Had I been out and they knew I was gay, it wouldn’t have necessarily made their views different, but they would have at least talked differently. My bosses would have at least been better bystanders, like, ‘Oh my god, Eric’s gay, we can’t talk like this.’” That atmosphere didn’t stop Fanning from eventually coming out, but it did make him wonder if he wanted to work at the Pentagon. “It didn’t occur to me at the time that doing my job and doing it well, and others joining alongside me, could change the narrative and environment.” Serving in the Obama administration, Fanning—then focused on lifting the ban on trans servicepeople (now re-established by Trump)—invited trans servicepeople to lunch with the chiefs of their branch of the military to talk about their experiences, “to humanize their story. It brought a whole new dimension to the issue.” Fanning is hopeful that the courts or a Biden administration will strike the trans military ban down. “The debate shouldn’t be, ‘Should these people serve?’ They already are. Trans people, like gay people, like women, have always been in the military. The policies should simply be updated to reflect it. We want and need people to join the military. Why are we making it more difficult for those who really want to? This is not about ‘identity politics,’ as people sometimes say. It’s about striking down barriers that are not related to the requirements to do a job.” Fanning recalled that when the issue of “religious accommodations” was debated in the Army, he found the top brass resistant. “The colonels had the attitude ‘We’ll make it work,’ and then I met one young officer who told me that he was training alongside a Sikh who wore a turban, and ‘it’s fine,’ he said. Young people are growing up in a different world. When we were repealing ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’ my boss spoke to his daughter about what she thought. She said, ‘I think you’re an idiot for even asking me the question.’” Leaving her post, Freedman-Gurspan said she and her colleagues had “prepared a lot” for the Trump administration, “but they tossed the memos out. The reality is they have not done one positive thing for the LGBTQ community but instead a slew of anti-LGBTQ things. It’s such a shame. Our focus was on the American public writ large, while this administration has selected a few groups who will benefit, while excluding others, like immigrants and LGBTQ folks.” As an LGBTQ presidential appointee, she hoped she was “not just giving back to the LGBTQ community, but to the country at large, and it was an immense pleasure to do so.” The numbers of LGBTQ appointees under Obama had, said Chang, made for a powerful community of people and colleagues then and now, which at the time—busy as they all were—“gave me a delightful window into the diversity of experiences and people in different parts of government.” Many still keep in touch and meet up at events, said Chang, now a consultant and author of Lean Impact: How to Innovate for Radically Greater Social Good. While Chang has not followed every LGBTQ twist and turn of the Trump administration, “because it has been so disheartening,” she has heard that many LGBTQ people working in government do not feel as supported as they did before. “This is people’s careers and livelihoods, and when they feel they can’t be their full selves it’s damaging on so many levels,” she said. “There is a wealth of LGBTQ talent and experience” Ruben J. Gonzales told The Daily Beast that the “first-ever” targets the Victory Institute is announcing Friday would be “more likely” realized under a Biden than second Trump administration. Despite the pro-equality rollbacks of the last four years, Gonzales said there has been a doubling in the number of out LGBTQ elected officials across the country—from fewer than 430 in 2016 to more than 860 now. “The number of out LGBTQ senators doubled with the election of Kyrsten Sinema [Arizona; alongside Tammy Baldwin, Wisconsin], and governors with the election of Jared Polis [Colorado; alongside Kate Brown, Oregon],” he said. Gonzales prefers not to look at why it has taken so long to break glass ceilings but rather observes that “there is a wealth of LGBTQ talent and experience” that should make the targets identified by the institute achievable, including the LGBTQ judges serving at every level of the court system who would make sound SCOTUS nominees. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Maura Healey (Massachusetts’ attorney general), and Rep. Mark Takano (D-CA) would make excellent Cabinet secretaries or hold senior positions, Gonzales said, while Pete Buttigieg could be a “well-informed” secretary of state, “representing our country well and restoring some of the faith lost in the United States.” An LGBTQ pick in the health and housing departments would be powerful, given the Trump administration’s deployment of anti-trans policies in both. When it comes to the Supreme Court, Gonzales noted “the depth and nuance” that Justice Sonia Sotomayor brought to her recent DACA concurrence as reflecting how valuable a future LGBTQ justice’s lived experience could be on the bench. The same principle applies to a Senate-approved Cabinet-level position, Gonzales said. “The presence of LGBTQ officials in these rooms makes room for more understanding and a much more nuanced conversation about our lives, and how those lives are reflected in policies and rulings.” “LGBTQ folks serving in any capacity in any place of employment bring their authentic selves and that perspective to work,” said Raffi Freedman-Gurspan. “One of the great things about the Obama administration was that many of us were out and serving in different positions.” Freedman-Gurspan said the plurality of LGBTQ voices in the Obama administration was a strength she hopes is replicated in future administrations, while recognizing that the LGBTQ community “is not a monolith. We have diversity in our politics and community—and that is part of a healthy democracy and human condition. “However, it is troubling to know our community—especially the trans community—has really been a target of this administration. We’ve seen rollbacks for trans kids in schools, to the trans military ban, and most recently in access to health care. We can’t see that the few gay men in the Trump administration have fostered any goodwill toward our community from the administration itself.” For Eric Fanning, a Senate-approved Cabinet pick would be more potent a first than an LGBTQ Supreme Court justice, “because from Day 1 the president can choose that person.” The Victory Institute’s presidential appointments project, which benefited Fanning, he hopes will benefit others. “Diverse teams lead to more creative solutions,” he said. The challenge now, he said, is to ensure that “diversity” does not just mean white gay men but LGBTQ people of color, LGBTQ women, and trans people. In the national security field, Fanning said, “there is a broad, deep, diverse bench like never before of women, minorities, and LGBTQ people who are worthy of many positions. My hope is that the ceiling will be broken at the Pentagon with the first female secretary of defense and she will be awesome.” For Freedman-Gurspan, any of the symbolic first-ever appointments identified by the Victory Institute would be important to fill. If a SCOTUS justice, “I just want to make sure they are a good judge who understands the law and is impartial. A Cabinet secretary would have real practical impact on people’s lives. As a trans person, I am part of a community affected by this. I want kids like me treated as equals, for people like me not to be kicked out of housing, and that if they have complaints that those complaints are not falling on unresponsive ears and eyes and are taken seriously.” Freedman-Gurspan is now the deputy states director at the National Democratic Redistributing Committee, focused on “ending partisan gerrymandering.” She said the young person mulling a career in politics versus “becoming a nuclear scientist” should know the latter could mean ending up running NASA one day, and having just as much public impact—perhaps more—as forming public policy. Would Fanning like to take on a top job again? “I’m very happy with work and life now,” he said cautiously. (He is president and CEO of the Aerospace Industries Association.) “Those of us who do this have public service in our blood. It’s a calling. I don’t know when, but at some point I would love another opportunity to serve in that capacity.” “Whoever is elected in November will make a big difference,” Ann Mei Chang said. “Biden has a commitment to LGBTQ issues and staff compared to what we see in the Trump administration. There will be setbacks such as this current administration, but, as Martin Luther King said, ‘The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.’ In the fullness of time, in the grand scheme of things, we will continue to see progress.” The State Department, former Ambassador Hormel told The Daily Beast, is particularly “pathetic” and a “major international disaster” under Trump. “I’m very concerned about how long it will take to mend relationships. The current secretary of state [Mike Pompeo] has taken actions that are appalling, and totally unsupportive of our position in the world, particularly when it comes to LGBTQ people.” “The most important single thing any LGBTQ person can do is come out,” Hormel said. “I have been saying this for 50 years. People still claim they don’t know any LGBTQ people, they still try and make out we are something we are not. Coming out is the most powerful weapon against that.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

    "[] President Trump has been badmouthing vote-by-mail ballots for some time now, claiming without any evidence that this perfectly acceptable form of voting he himself practices leads to widespread fraud. But he has moved beyond mere trash talk and is now actively assaulting democracy by resisting efforts to give the U.S. Postal Service the emergency funding it needs to process the expected flood of ballots mailed by voters hoping to avoid crowding at the polls while an infectious disease is still lurking. Meanwhile, the USPS has been engaging in some alarming activities under the direction of a generous Trump campaign donor, Louis DeJoy, who was handpicked by Trump appointees to be postmaster general. These include removing mailboxes in some U.S. cities (a practice the service said it suspended Friday afternoon), decommissioning hundreds of mail sorting machines across the country and making procedural changes that have slowed down regular mail delivery. I can almost hear the president muttering, \"Let people get the China virus if they want to vote against me so badly.\" But here’s why I’m not overly worried about the postal chicanery when it comes to my own vote on Nov. 3: I live in a state that has been preparing for this moment for years. Well, maybe not exactly this moment. Who imagined that the U.S. might simultaneously face the threats of a deadly pandemic and a former reality-star president intent on undermining democracy in order to keep himself in power? Four years ago, California lawmakers passed the Voter’s Choice Act, an election modernization law designed to make it easier for people to vote. In so doing, they in set in motion a system that will give the most populous U.S. state at least some cover in the coming election storm. The act allowed but did not require counties to dump the clunky, old-school method of voting at assigned precincts on election day in favor of strategically placed voting centers that open 10 days before the election for in-person voting and to accept dropped-off ballots. Part of the change entails sending a ballot to every registered voter. So far, 15 counties including Los Angeles County deliberately adopted this model. The rest are being hustled into an emergency form of Voter's Choice Act by the governor's order to mail a ballot to every voter this fall. (That sounds more impressive than it actually is. Roughly three-fourths of state voters were already receiving a ballot by mail before the pandemic.) Though Californians will still rely on snail mail — the nickname never seemed so apt before — to receive a blank ballot, the vast majority can bypass the unpredictability of the U.S. Postal Service and the risk of in-person voting by using a ballot drop-off box at any vote center in their county. For those who must mail a ballot, this year the three-day grace period has been extended to 17 days after the election. Is this system perfect? Of course not — no system is. In the March primary, more than 100,000, or 1.5%, of the 7 million mail ballots cast were disqualified for various reasons, though by far the most common problem was that the ballots either were postmarked after election day or didn't arrive at elections headquarters within the grace period. Nevertheless, California's approach will give voters here one less thing to worry about than residents in many other states, who may just have to rely on a Postal Service the president appears determined to render unreliable.",

    "[] CHICAGO — Former Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson, known as “Big Jim” during a long career that eventually made him the state’s longest-serving chief executive, has died. He was 84. Thompson died shortly after 8 p.m. Friday at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago, his wife, Jayne, told the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times. The Tribune, citing a police report, reported Thompson had been recovering there for several weeks after suffering heart problems. “It was very sudden,” Jayne Thompson told the Tribune. “I was told that his heart simply stopped.” James Thompson, a Republican from Chicago, was first elected governor in 1976 and eventually served four terms before leaving office in 1991. A moderate, he managed the state through recession years in the 1980s. He also helped put together a plan to help the Chicago White Sox get a new stadium to head off a potential move out of state. “As the longest-serving governor in Illinois history, ‘Big Jim’ was known to treat people he encountered with kindness and decency,” Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker said in a statement Saturday. “Jim dedicated himself to building positive change for Illinois, and he set an example for public service of which Illinoisans should be proud.” Before becoming governor, Thompson rose to prominence as a prosecutor, making a name for himself as someone who fought public corruption — a reputation he carried into his time in office. “From the time he signed the Political Honesty Initiative — to stop legislative conflicts of interest, double dipping, and advance pay for politicians — when he was first running for Governor in 1976, Gov. Jim Thompson stood for cleaning up corruption in Illinois politics and government,” former Gov. Pat Quinn, a Democrat who left office in 2015, said in a statement. While working in the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office in the early 1960s, he prosecuted Lenny Bruce after the comedian held up a photograph of a woman’s breast while on stage at a Chicago nightclub. After he was appointed U.S. attorney for the northern Illinois district by President Richard Nixon, Thompson became known for anti-corruption cases, including the prosecution of Democratic former Gov. Otto Kerner Jr., by then a federal appeals judge. Thompson and his staff uncovered massive voter fraud in 1972, an effort that led to 83 indictments and 66 convictions or guilty pleas. He headed the prosecution that led to the conviction of a powerful Chicago alderman and took part in the investigation of Republican Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, who eventually pleaded no contest to tax evasion. Widely respected across Illinois, Thompson was honored in 1993 when the state government building in downtown Chicago was named after him. He also later served as a member of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States to examine the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “He was a great guy, no question about that,” said Republican former Gov. George Ryan, a longtime friend who held the office from 1999 to 2003. But Thompson also made headlines when, as a leader of the law firm Winston & Strawn, he agreed to defend Ryan on a pro bono basis in a corruption case that eventually landed Ryan in prison. In a 2015 article when Thompson’s retirement from the firm after a quarter century was announced, Crain’s Chicago Business noted that Thompson’s decision to represent his fellow former governor without receiving payment ultimately cost the firm more than $10 million.",
    "[] President Donald Trump on Wednesday declined to condemn supporters of QAnon, the fringe conspiracy group that portrays the president as saving the world from an underground child sex ring. “I don’t know much about the movement other than I understand that they like me very much, which I appreciate,” Trump said during a news briefing at the White House. Trump, who rose to political prominence on the back of the false birtherism conspiracy against former President Barack Obama, has often flirted with conspiracy theories while in office. But Wednesday’s comments go the farthest yet toward embracing QAnon, which the FBI has labeled as a potential domestic terrorist threat. The baseless theory, which has grown in popularity among Trump’s base, claims there is a deep-state cabal of Satanist pedophiles in the American government that Trump is working to defeat with the help of an anonymous figure within the government. Trump portrayed the group as comprising patriotic Americans concerned about the breakdown of law and order in cities around the country. “I have heard that it is gaining in popularity, and from what I hear, these are people that when they watch the streets of Portland, when they watch what happened in New York City,” Trump said, “these are people that don’t like seeing what’s going on.” “I’ve heard these are people that love our country and they just don't like seeing it,” he argued. “So I don’t know really anything about it other than they do supposedly like me and they also would like to see problems in these areas, like especially the areas that we’re talking about, go away.” When a reporter outlined the group’s beliefs, explaining to the president that QAnon supporters believe Trump is “secretly saving the world from this satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals,” Trump shrugged at the notion. “I haven't heard that,” he replied. “But is that supposed to be a bad thing or good thing? If I can help save the world from problems, I’m willing to do it. I’m willing to put myself out there.” Trump added: “And we are, actually. We’re saving the world from a radical-left philosophy that will destroy this country, and when this country is gone, the rest of the world would follow. The rest of the world would follow. That’s the importance of this country.” Earlier Wednesday,\nFacebook announced\nthat it was stepping up efforts to punish accounts linked to groups like QAnon. The social media network has removed hundreds of pages linked to the group and taken action against around 10,000 accounts on Instagram. The group has seen its popularity increase throughout the pandemic, and several open QAnon supporters have\nwon Republican congressional primaries\nthis year, including one House candidate in Georgia who is likely headed to Congress. Following that primary victory, Trump lauded the candidate in a tweet, calling her a future star in the Republican Party.",
    "[] WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump wants to deny China some of the proceeds from the sale of ByteDance's U.S. operations of its video-sharing app TikTok, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Wednesday, but it would be unusual for any company that acquires TikTok to provide funds to the U.S. Treasury. \"Well he's said that,\" Kudlow told CNBC when asked about Trump's demand that part of the proceeds from the TikTok sale he has ordered go to the U.S. Treasury. \"I acknowledge that it's unusual. The president has his own mind on some of these things,\" Kudlow said. \"I don't know whether that will end up being the case when the Treasury gets its bids in from potential bidders. But the president has said that. I think he probably would like to deny China some of the proceeds of the TikTok sale,\" Kudlow added. Trump ordered ByteDance last week to divest TikTok's U.S. operations within 90 days, the latest effort to ramp up pressure on the Chinese company over concerns about the safety of the personal data it handles. Trump has said he would support an effort by Microsoft Corp to buy TikTok's American operations if the U.S. government gets a \"substantial portion\" of the proceeds, but has also said there are other interested potential buyers. Oracle Corp has joined some of the investors of TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance in pursuing a bid for the app's operations in North America, Australia and New Zealand, according to people familiar with the matter.

    "[] The nearly thousand-page Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee report released Tuesday, the culmination of a three-year bipartisan investigation, leaves no room for doubt: Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign exposed our country to significant counterintelligence risks. While partisans can argue about whether or its report’s findings constitute “collusion” with the Kremlin, the report flatly states that the Trump campaign “presented attractive targets for foreign influence, creating notable counterintelligence vulnerabilities.” One operative who exploited the chaos was Paul Manafort, who had worked closely with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska between 2004 and 2009. The Intelligence Committee found that Deripaska “conducts influence operations,” in coordination with and under the direction of the Russian government. Manafort, who had run multi-million dollar influence campaigns for Deripaska “in numerous countries” of interest to Russia, volunteered in 2016 to work as Trump’s campaign chairman—for free. While a normal campaign might have found Manafort’s ties to Deripaska troubling, the Trump campaign did not. Manafort, of course, was later convicted of bank fraud, tax violations and related crimes unrelated to the Trump campaign. Sen. Richard Burr Puts a Crack in Trump’s Red Wall The report states that Manafort worked closely with Konstantin Kilimnik, whom it describes unequivocally as “a Russian intelligence officer.” Special Counsel Robert Mueller had concluded only that Kilimnik had “ties” to Russian intelligence. The report also states that “the Committee obtained some information suggesting Kilimnik may have been connected to the (Russian intelligence service’s) hack and leak operation targeting the 2016 U.S. election.” According to the report, Manafort repeatedly shared secret campaign information with Kilimnik. Like Mueller, however, the committee was unable to determine why—in part because Manafort and Kilimnik covered their tracks. For example, Manafort and Kilimnik used a technique called “foldering,” in which they used the same email account, left messages for each other in the “drafts” folder and then read the messages without sending them. The committee found that Manafort's presence on the campaign and proximity to Trump “created opportunities for Russian intelligence services to exert influence over, and acquire confidential information on, the Trump Campaign.” Manafort's “willingness to share information with individuals closely affiliated with the Russian intelligence services, particularly Kilimnik and associates of Oleg Deripaska, represented a grave counterintelligence threat.” The committee also found that the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between senior campaign advisers and Russians also exposed the campaign to even more foreign influence than previously known. Manafort, along with Donald Trump, Jr. and Jared Kushner, met with Russian contacts for the purpose of obtaining incriminating information about Hillary Clinton. One of the Russians at the meeting was lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. According to the report, her connections to Russian intelligence “were far more extensive and concerning than what had been publicly known,” noting that information she used at the meeting was also used in an operation with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that the Trump Tower meeting was part of an effort coordinated by Russia. This meeting had been planned in a series of email messages offering documents and information harmful to Clinton as “part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.” In response, Trump, Jr., famously replied, “If it’s what you say, I love it.” The meeting was a product of the Trump family’s relationship with another Russian oligarch, Aras Agalarov, and his son, a musician, whom Trump had met at the Miss Universe pageant in 2013. The committee concluded that the senior Agalarov was “likely” acting at the behest of the Russian government. Rather than reporting this outreach to the FBI, the Trump campaign officials met with the Russians. It appears that the meeting ended without the promised information, but Trump, Jr., exposed the campaign to blackmail by responding to the email, and compounded the error by taking the meeting. George Papadopoulos, a campaign foreign policy adviser, also exposed the campaign to counterintelligence risk by seeking to secure a meeting between Trump and Putin. The committee found that Papadopoulos’s efforts introduced him to individuals who raised counterintelligence concerns, and made him an unwitting “prime intelligence target and potential vector for malign Russian influence.” In addition to creating vulnerabilities by using inexperienced or shady campaign staff, the Trump campaign also actively welcomed assistance through the hacked and stolen emails of the Clinton campaign. The report found that Trump campaign staff sought advance notice about releases of stolen emails by WikiLeaks, “created messaging strategies” in anticipation of their release and encouraged further leaks. The Trump campaign also “publicly undermined the attribution of the hack-and-leak campaign to Russia and was indifferent to whether it and WikiLeaks were furthering a Russian election interference effort.” In stark contrast to Attorney General William Barr’s characterization of these events before the House Judiciary Committee as the “bogus Russiagate scandal,” the Senate report reaches the same conclusions as Mueller—that the Russian government attacked our election to help Trump become president, and some members of Trump’s campaign welcomed the assistance from a hostile foreign adversary. But this report goes further by demonstrating how Trump’s win-at-all cost strategy and reckless practices exposed his campaign, and our election, to foreign influence. Among the report’s recommendations is one that campaigns notify the FBI of all foreign offers of assistance and to reject the use of foreign material, especially if it has been obtained through the violation of U.S. law. With another election right around the corner, both parties would be wise to set aside politics and acknowledge the threat posed by Russia to interfere in our election. Read more at The Daily Beast.

    "[] Americans are increasingly relying on Medicaid — a key part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare — to provide health care coverage as the economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic continues across the U.S. Raising the stakes as a vaccine is developed, the Supreme Court will begin hearing oral arguments on a case that could determine the fate of Obamacare on November 10, one week after Election Day. A final judgment on the constitutionality of the landmark health care law’s “individual mandate” provision, and potentially the entire law, is expected in the spring of 2021. Supporters of the ACA have said that if the health care bill were to be overturned, it could lead to “total chaos” as millions of Americans would lose health insurance coverage and struggle to afford health care. And even with Obamacare in place, a new Commonwealth Fund survey found that 43.4% of adults were inadequately insured for the first half of 2020, and half of adults who spent time “any time uninsured” reported problems paying their medical bills. If Obamacare is dismantled, as the Trump administration wants and a 2021 Supreme Court decision could entail, then the situation becomes even worse for millions of Americans already struggling with health care bills. “This is just a persistent problem in the health system right now, and it’s likely to get worse as this economic downturn, the dramatic economic downturn, continues and affects people’s incomes,\" Sara Collins, vice president of the Commonwealth Fund, told Yahoo Finance. Since March 1, over 54 million Americans have filed for unemployment and an estimated 27 million people have lost employed-sponsored health care coverage. Many of those unemployed have turned to signing up for COBRA, the ACA marketplace, or Medicaid. “So if you lose your job right now, your ability to retain some form of health care coverage is going to really depend on whether your state has expanded Medicaid or not,” Jesse Cross-Call, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), told Yahoo Finance. The Medicaid expansion is a key component of Obamacare. Overall, Medicaid “promotes more comprehensive benefits than private insurance at significantly lower out-of-pocket cost to beneficiaries, but its lower payment rates to health care providers and lower administrative costs make the program very efficient,” according to CBPP. The ACA originally intended for national Medicaid expansion, but the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the policy was “unduly coercive” and left it up to the states to decide if they wanted to adopt that expansion. “It has created this patchwork where Texas is a non-expansion state, but next door in New Mexico, it is an expansion state,” Cross-Call said of the resulting system. “If you’re a low-income worker with income right below the poverty line, you’re treated differently depending on which state you live in.” Over 73 million people were enrolled in Medicaid for the month of May, an increase from the previous three months, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). And March’s increase, according to CMS, was the first increase in enrollment since March 2017. To be eligible for Medicaid, an individual has to have an annual income that’s below 138% of the federal poverty level; live in a state that adopted the Medicaid expansion; and either be pregnant, elderly, disabled, a parent/caretaker, or a child. The threshold increases depending on the number of people in a household. “Medicaid is a means-tested program,” Robin Rudowitz, vice president for the Kaiser Family Foundation, told Yahoo Finance. “It’s countercyclical. Just like in previous economic downturns, when individuals lose jobs and incomes, more people become eligible and enroll in the program. Unlike the Great Recession, now the Affordable Care Act is in place. We’ve always seen Medicaid enrollment rise during economic downturns, but now, we’re also always seeing a lot of people who become uninsured.” And while Medicaid is crucial to providing coverage for the more vulnerable populations like the elderly and disabled, it’s also a major source of health care coverage for essential and front-line workers throughout this pandemic. “There was a need for health care coverage before COVID, but there is even more so now,” Cross-Call said. “These are working individuals. There’s a large number of them who work in what are considered at this point to be essential or front line industries. These are folks who are home health aides or who work in a grocery store. Basically, they don’t have the luxury of working from home and they’re in settings where they’re likely to be exposed to the coronavirus.” At least 5 million essential workers — including those who work in health care, food production, grocery stores, and transportation/waste management — are enrolled in Medicaid, according to a CBPP analysis. The study also estimated that an additional 650,000 essential workers who are uninsured would be eligible for Medicaid if their states adopted the expansion. “The states that haven’t implemented at this point, by and large, are conservative states,” Cross-Call said. “There does seem to be some ideological component about government health care in there. But this cost issue has been persistent.” Furthermore, according to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation, if the remaining non-expansion states were to finally adopt the expansion, “an estimated 2.8 million adults who were uninsured in 2020 would move out of the coverage gap by 2021 and instead have access to Medicaid coverage.” Medicaid is a costly program, accounting for 16% of total national health expenditures in 2018 at $597.4 billion. “There have been some consistent arguments that opponents have made through the years,” Cross-Call said. “They’ve been worrying about uncertainty about what it would cost the state to do it because for the first few years, the federal government paid the entire cost of the expansion. Now they’re paying 90%, so the state has to pick up 10% of the cost, and that’s the way it’s going to be every year going forward.” The cost of Medicaid for both the federal and state governments has been a controversial topic over the years. In a paper for Mercatus Center, researchers Brian Blase and Aaron Yelowitz found that some states were improperly enrolling people in their Medicaid programs. “It’s hard for me to speculate on motives,” Yelowitz, a professor of economics at the University of Kentucky, told Yahoo Finance. “What we can say for sure is that both from a view at 10,000 feet or at the ground level, there appear to be many people who are enrolled in Medicaid — pre-pandemic is what we were studying — who have incomes that make them ineligible for the program.” The research found that adults mainly between the ages of 19 to 64 weren’t having their incomes properly verified. “Things like how quickly we verify your income and when your income goes up, which in good times people get pay raises and find jobs and so forth,” Yelowitz said. “Then basically, you’re supposed to be removed from the program within a certain period of time and that doesn’t seem to be happening as much as it should.” Another “structural weakness” that Yelowitz encountered in his research that some people were stating that their family size was larger than it actually was in order to qualify for Medicaid. “You might wonder: Is this a big deal or a small deal?” Yelowitz said. “You’d imagine if you had 50 different states determining eligibility for literally the same person with the same ‘rules,’ you might come up with different outcomes, but it wouldn’t be too much different if you took a group of 100 people. But what you do see if in reality that the audit reports really do say a fair number of people don’t seem to be eligible for the program at all.” Adriana is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.

    "[] Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan speaks exclusively to Yahoo Finance UK European stock markets closed lower on Tuesday, after struggling for direction for much of the session even as US stocks hit new record-highs. Equity markets across Europe opened down over half a percent on Tuesday morning, with heavy industry and energy stocks dragging indexes lower. Mining and metals giant BHP (BHP.L) fell 1.8% in London after cutting its dividend. Markets across Europe had turned positive by mid-morning, however, helped by rebounding airline stocks. But momentum faded as the session wore on. The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) ended the day down 0.9%, while the DAX (^GDAXI) lost 0.4%, and France’s CAC 40 (^FCHI) fell 0.8%. Spain’s IBEX 35 (^IBEX) closed down 0.8% and the FTSE MIB (FTSEMIB.MI) dropped 0.6% in Milan. “The dollar, and the global markets, appears to be struggling in the face of the latest US-China spat, i.e. the most recent round of restrictions placed on Huawei,” said Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at trading platform SpreadEx. The US on Monday night expanded sanctions on China’s Huawei. The US Commerce Department added 38 Huawei affiliates to its economic blacklist. They included Huawei subsidiaries in European countries like France, Russia, Germany, and the UK. “There also the issue of the Congress COVID-19 fiscal relief plan – or, rather, the lack of one,” Campbell said. The disappointing session in Europe came despite a higher open for Wall Street. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3% in early trade to mark a new all-time high of 3,395, eclipsing the previous record set in February. The S&P 500 was still up 0.1% by the time Europe closed, while the Nasdaq (^IXIC) was 0.4% higher. The Dow Jones (^DJI) had dipped by 0.1%. “Equity indices in the US are still either printing new all-time highs in the case of the Nasdaq, or hovering just below their old highs,” said Fawad Razaqzada, a market analyst at ThinkMarkets. “Stocks have been continually pushing higher since March not only because of optimism over a sharp economic recovery and hopes there will be an effective vaccine soon, but more to the point due to expectations that the Fed will maintain its expansionary monetary policy stance for a long period of time. Admittedly, the US stock markets do look overbought.” Action in Asian stock markets was mixed overnight. Japan’s Nikkei (^N255) closed down 0.2% and the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index (^HSI) fell 0.2%, but China’s Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) rose 0.3% and the Shenzen Component (399001.SZ) gained 0.1%. In Australia, the ASX 200 (^AXJO) rose 0.7%. In London, house builder Persimmon (PSN.L) ended the day up over 8% to top the FTSE 100 after confirming its business was rebounding strongly from the COVID-19 lockdown. Rival house builders Barratt Developments (BDEV.L) and Berkeley Group (BKG.L) rallied in sympathy. Listen to the latest podcast from Yahoo Finance UK",
    "[] President Trump's 2016 campaign eagerly capitalized on Russia's efforts to meddle in the U.S. election four years ago, according to a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report that raises new concerns about connections between his top aides and Moscow. As Russian military intelligence officers were releasing hacked Democratic Party emails through WikiLeaks, the report said the Trump campaign \"sought to maximize the impact of those leaks\" and \"created messaging strategies\" around them. The report, released Tuesday, found that the Trump campaign \"publicly undermined\" the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that Russia was behind the email hack and \"was indifferent to whether it and Wikileaks were furthering a Russian election interference effort.\" The 966-page document describes Paul Manafort, the president's former campaign chairman who is serving prison time for financial crimes, as a \"grave counterintelligence threat\" because of his relationship with Konstantin Kilimnik, a business partner in Ukraine who is conclusively described as a \"Russian intelligence officer.\" Although Kilimnik has been the target of scrutiny before, the report adds a new wrinkle, saying the committee \"obtained some information suggesting Kilimnik may have been connected to the GRU's hack and leak operation targeting the 2016 U.S. election.\" GRU is an acronym for Russian military intelligence; no such allegation has previously been made, and details are redacted from the report. Manafort and Kilimnik used encrypted messaging applications and codes to communicate, sometimes telling each other to look at the \"tea bag\" or the \"updated travel schedule\" when it was time to check the email account they shared. Some phones were referred to as \"bat phones,\" the report states. The report is the fifth and final volume from the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russian election meddling. It arrives soon after Trump's own intelligence officials warned that Moscow was revisiting its playbook ahead of the 2020 election by trying to undermine Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Although the latest report does not dramatically alter the public's understanding of Russia's operations in 2016, it's the most comprehensive examination yet and it represents a rare bipartisan consensus on a hotly contested topic. A statement from Trump's campaign called claims of collusion with Russia the \"greatest political scandal in the history of this country.\" The report includes new details about Roger Stone, Trump's longtime political advisor. Although Trump previously said in written answers to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III that he did not recall discussing WikiLeaks with Stone, the committee concluded that “Trump did, in fact, speak with Stone about WikiLeaks.” After Stone told Trump and other campaign officials in either April or May 2016 that WikiLeaks would release information damaging to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, the report states that \"Trump directed campaign officials to stay in touch with Roger Stone about future WikiLeaks activities regarding Clinton-related emails.\" It's unclear whether Stone knew in advance that WikiLeaks was releasing hacked emails, but the report said he repeatedly communicated about the topic with Trump campaign officials, and \"at their direction, Stone took action to gain inside knowledge.\" \"In August 2016, following the campaign's tasking, Stone obtained information indicating that John Podesta would be a target of an upcoming release, prior to WikiLeaks releasing Podesta's emails on October 7,\" the report found. Stone communicated this information to Trump and other senior campaign officials. Trump has since commuted Stone’s sentence for lying to Congress and witness tampering, sparing him prison time. Podesta served as Clinton's 2016 campaign chairman, and the release of embarrassing details disclosed in his stolen emails dominated the final weeks of the campaign. According to the report, WikiLeaks \"likely knew it was assisting a Russian intelligence influence effort,\" and Trump allies tried to spur more releases to help his campaign. For example, the Trump campaign team heard about the \"Access Hollywood\" videotape an hour before it was revealed by the Washington Post. Stone told Jerome Corsi, an associate in right-wing circles, to get WikiLeaks to \"drop the Podesta emails immediately.\" WikiLeaks did so 30 minutes after the story about the tape was published, although it's unclear whether any message was communicated between Corsi and WikiLeaks. At the same time Stone was trying to learn about WikiLeaks' plans, he was helping Trump draft tweets friendly to Russia, the report said. In an email to Trump's assistant titled \"Tweets Mr. Trump requested last night,\" Stone suggested tweeting \"I want a new detente with Russia under Putin.\" The concerted effort to harness an illegal Russian operation to harm Clinton's candidacy undermines Trump's frequent claims of \"no collusion\" between his campaign and Moscow. No criminal conspiracy, however, was established by Mueller, who ultimately did not charge any members of the president's campaign with working with Russians. The Senate Intelligence Committee was alarmed by efforts to mislead or stonewall its investigation. According to a letter reviewed by The Times last week, the panel told federal prosecutors last year that three witnesses — including former campaign strategist Stephen K. Bannon — may have provided false testimony. Lying to Congress is a felony. In addition, the latest report said the White House tried to limit testimony to the committee with claims of executive privilege that had \"no basis in law.\" By comparison, former officials from President Obama's administration \"freely shared their conversations.\" The committee was also concerned about whether anyone encouraged Michael Cohen, the president's former personal lawyer, to lie about Trump's pursuit of a luxury skyscraper in Moscow during the campaign. After Cohen testified to the committee for the first time, he said he received a call from Jay Sekulow, one of the president's other lawyers, who said Trump \"heard you did great\" and there could be \"pardons\" or \"pre-pardons\" down the line. Sekulow denied the allegation to The Times on Tuesday. \"There were no discussions with Michael Cohen about pardons or pre-pardons,\" he said. Republicans and Democrats are in consensus on the facts in the report, which involved more than 200 witnesses and 1 million pages of documents. But each side framed the findings differently. “We can say, without any hesitation, that the committee found absolutely no evidence that then-candidate Donald Trump or his campaign colluded with the Russian government to meddle in the 2016 election,” acting Committee Chairman Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said in a statement. “What the committee did find, however, is very troubling. We found irrefutable evidence of Russian meddling.” According to Rubio, the committee also found that \"Russia took advantage of members of the [Trump] transition team’s relative inexperience in government, opposition to Obama administration policies, and Trump’s desire to deepen ties with Russia to pursue unofficial channels through which Russia could conduct diplomacy.” In a separate statement, Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the committee, called the report “the most comprehensive examination of ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign to date — a breathtaking level of contacts between Trump officials and Russian government operatives that is a very real counterintelligence threat to our elections.” Richard M. Burr (R-N.C.), who as chairman oversaw the committee’s investigation until stepping aside in the spring, said Russia’s ongoing interest in interfering with democracy shouldn’t be skimmed over in the report. “One of the committee’s most important — and overlooked — findings is that much of Russia’s activities weren’t related to producing a specific electoral outcome, but attempted to undermine our faith in the democratic process itself. Their aim is to sow chaos, discord, and distrust. Their efforts are not limited to elections. The threat is ongoing,” Burr said in a statement. The report does not focus on Russia's attempts to meddle in the 2020 election, but there are hints of the ongoing operation. For example, Kilimnik used a Twitter account — \"registered under a false persona\" — to spread allegations about Biden and corruption in Ukraine. Trump later asked Ukraine's president to investigate Biden, a conversation that led to his impeachment by the Democratic-led House of Representatives. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. U.S. intelligence officials have said publicly that Moscow is trying to undercut Biden with allegations involving Ukraine, where his son was on the board of a gas company. But Trump has once again tried to downplay the threat. “I don’t care what anybody says,\" he said recently, while amplifying Russian disinformation. For example, U.S. intelligence officials said a Kremlin-linked Ukrainian politician was releasing recordings of Biden's phone calls from when he served as vice president. Trump shared details from the recordings on Twitter on Sunday, retweeting an account that has since been suspended.",
    "[] Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, on Tuesday slapped down Donald Trump's talk of an out-of-control coronavirus \"surge\" in New Zealand as \"patently wrong\". She expressed dismay after the US president exaggerated the new virus outbreak in New Zealand as a \"huge surge\" that Americans would do well to avoid. \"Anyone who is following,\" Ms Ardern said, \"will quite easily see that New Zealand's nine cases in a day does not compare to the United States' tens of thousands.\" \"Obviously, it's patently wrong,\" she added of Mr Trump's remarks, in unusually blunt criticism from an American ally. New Zealand had been hailed as a global success story after eradicating local transmission of the virus and Ms Ardern was lauded as the \"anti-Trump\". But the recent discovery of a cluster in Auckland forced the country's largest city back into lockdown. At an election rally in Minnesota on Monday, Mr Trump jumped on that development as evidence his critics - who held up New Zealand as an example - were wrong. \"You see what is going on in New Zealand,\" Mr Trump told supporters. \"They beat it; they beat it. It was like front page (news), they beat it because they wanted to show me something.\" Citing a \"big surge in New Zealand\", Mr Trump added: \"It's terrible. We don't want that.\" New Zealand, with a population of five million, has around 1,300 coronavirus cases since the pandemic began roughly eight months ago and around 70 active cases. The United States, on the other hand, is the hardest-hit nation in the world with well over five million cases and more than 170,000 deaths in a population of 328 million. It is not the first time that Mr Trump and Ms Ardern - a relatively young, centre-Left leader - have clashed. Shortly after her stunning election win in 2017, President Trump met her at a summit in Vietnam and joked she had \"caused a lot of upset in her country\". \"You know, no one marched when I was elected,\" she retorted, referring to the protests that followed Mr Trump's victory in 2016. Both leaders are heading into elections in the coming weeks, and for both, trading barbs is likely to play well with supporters. Ms Ardern has been forced to postpone the elections by a month because of the latest outbreak, putting her sizable lead in the polls at risk. President Trump is trailing Democrat Joe Biden in the polls and facing fierce criticism over his handling of the pandemic.",
    "[] (Bloomberg Opinion) -- “This is what collusion looks like.” That is how five Democratic senators, including vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris, view the fifth and final volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. Their argument rests on new evidence, which they say shows that Paul Manafort, former campaign manager for President Donald Trump, “was directly connected to the Russian meddling through his communications with an individual found to be a Russian intelligence officer.” It’s a devastating claim. The report itself, however, paints a more nuanced picture, though no less horrifying. Start with the Russian intelligence agent. He is a 50-year old man named Konstantin Kilimnik. The committee refers to him as a “Russian intelligence officer.” But Kilimnik does not have an official role in any Russian intelligence service. Instead, he “is part of a cadre of individuals ostensibly operating outside of the Russian government but who nonetheless implement Kremlin-directed influence operations.” Those initiatives are often funded by oligarchs close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s March 2019 report disclosed that Manafort funneled internal campaign polling and strategy documents to Kilimnik during the campaign. The Senate’s report fills in the blanks about their relationship. Manafort has known Kilimnik since at least 2005, when Manafort began working as a consultant to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Kilimnik, in addition to being a kind of Russian spy, was also a close aide to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Manafort had numerous business dealings with Deripaska over more than a decade, including influence operations that targeted countries in Europe, Africa and other former Soviet republics such as Georgia. By 2016, however, Manafort and Deripaska had had a falling out. Deripaska had sued Manafort for money he lost in a joint business venture. Instead of money — perhaps in lieu of payment — Manafort sent information to Deripaska, using Kilimnik as a go-between. The Senate committee “was unable to reliably determine why Manafort shared sensitive internal polling data or Campaign strategy with Kilimnik,” the report says. It does say that Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, “both claimed that it was part of an effort to resolve past business disputes and obtain new work with their past Russian and Ukrainian clients.” After Manafort resigned from the Trump campaign in August 2016, he kept up his relationship with both Kilimnik and some Trump campaign officials, such as the presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner. Kilimnik and Manafort schemed, for example cooking up a plan to persuade the president-elect to endorse a “peace plan” for Ukraine that would have cemented the gains won by Russia after its stealth invasion in 2014. Both men also communicated about how to counter the narrative that Russia sought to influence the 2016 election and discussed a communications strategy to pin the election interference on Ukraine. The report does not conclude that Kilimnik was involved in the Russian intelligence operation to hack Democratic Party emails and then publicize them through Wikileaks and other Russian backed websites. Rather, it says it has “information suggesting Kilimnik may have been connected to the GRU’s hack and leak operation targeting the 2016 U.S. election.” It goes on to say: “While this information suggests that a channel for coordination on the GRU hack-and-leak operation may have existed through Kilimnik, the Committee had limited insight into Kilimnik’s communications with Manafort and [redacted], all of whom used sophisticated communications security practices.” Regardless of whether Kilimnik was involved in the hacking and leaking of Democratic emails, the larger point is that Trump’s former campaign manager was so close to a Russian spy. That’s something both parties should condemn. At the same time, the report raises some deeper questions.  According to the report, Kilimnik worked for the International Republican Institute, a congressionally funded, nominally nonpartisan organization, from 1995 to 2005. He has claimed that he ended his work for the Russian government before joining. He was fired from his post in 2005, after the institute learned that he was working with Manafort. Nonetheless, Kilimnik was in “regular contact” with personnel serving in the political section of the U.S. embassy in Kiev until late 2016. To be sure, many U.S. diplomats were wary of him. But he was able in January 2017 to secure a visa to the U.S., where he met with Manafort. If Kilimnik was a Russian spy for this entire period — and the report gives evidence that indeed he was — then why didn’t the FBI or CIA do more to protect the U.S. embassy, or for that matter the International Republican Institute, from Kilimnik’s schemes? A similar problem arises with Deripaska, the long-time associate of Manafort who the report accuses of masterminding political-influence campaigns from Cyprus to Montenegro. Between 2014 and 2016, the FBI tried to recruit him as a source. The bureau was rebuffed, and he reportedly told the Kremlin about the approach. The new report finds that Christopher Steele, the former British spy who was contracted to produce the now-discredited dossier on the Trump campaign’s ties to the Kremlin, also had contracts with Deripaska — at the same time he was compiling his dossier on Trump. “The Committee found multiple links between Steele and Deripaska, including through two of Deripaska’s lawyers, and indications that Deripaska had early knowledge of Steele’s work,” the report says. “Steele had worked for Deripaska, likely beginning at least in 2012, and continued to work for him into 2017, providing a potential direct channel for Russian influence on the dossier.” Steele’s dossier makes a number of allegations against Manafort that the FBI was never able to confirm. And yet it never mentions one damning and true fact about him: namely, Manafort’s longstanding ties to Deripaska. Yet the FBI used that dossier to help obtain a surveillance warrant on a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page, and pressed to include its findings in the annex of the intelligence community’s assessment of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. After it became public in January 2017, the dossier also helped to shape the public narrative about Trump in the first two years of his presidency. Finally: It’s worth noting that, for most of the last two decades, the two men most responsible for protecting America from Russian threats are Robert Mueller and James Comey, who together directed the FBI from 2001 to 2017. It’s a pity that the FBI only got around to doing something about people such as Kilimnik and Deripaska — not to mention opportunistic Americans like Paul Manafort — until after the 2016 election.

    "[] BALTIMORE — Vice President Mike Pence will address the Republican National Convention next week from Fort McHenry in Baltimore, marking a return by national Republicans to a city President Donald Trump has called corrupt and “rodent infested.” Pence is scheduled to speak Wednesday at the fort, where 1,000 U.S. soldiers withstood a British bombardment in 1814, inspiring Francis Scott Key to write the poem that became “The Star-Spangled Banner,” according to a senior Trump campaign official on Thursday. The theme of the GOP convention — in which Trump and Pence are to be nominated for second-term bids — is “Honoring the Great American Story.” Each night has its own particular theme, and Wednesday’s is “Land of Heroes.” According to the campaign official, other speakers in various locations include Trump, U.S. Sens. Joni Ernst of Iowa and Tim Scott of South Carolina, former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley and U.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.",
    "[] To the editor: I have some questions for Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. (\"'Like Armageddon': Rotting food, dead animals and chaos at postal facilities amid cutbacks,\" Aug. 20) If an automated mail sorting machine processes 35,000 pieces of mail in one hour, how many pieces of mail can one postal service employee sort in the same amount of time? Will he hire more postal workers to make up the difference? If the Postal Service was in such disarray and needed a drastic overhaul, why did it take more than three years for the Trump administration to make changes? And, why did these changes have to happen right before an election in which a record number of voters will mail in their ballots? Something smells fishy, and it's not the dead chicks and crickets piling up on post office floors. Donna Sloan, Los Angeles .. To the editor: It recently took 13 days for a check to arrive from an adjacent city just two miles away. This week, I had three days with no mail at all. Unlike Humpty Dumpty, our postal service was intentionally pushed off the wall and has had a great fall, and now it appears we won't be able to put it back together again for a mere $25 billion. Kathy Harty, Sierra Madre .. To the editor: I have a thought experiment based on the recent turmoil at the U.S. Postal Service. Imagine you are on the board of an airline. Your new chief executive promises to make all planes depart on time. He does this, inevitably leaving briefly delayed connecting passengers stranded. The next flights out are unable to clear the backlog, and passengers stack up for days, even weeks. So, was your new CEO a good hire? Sure, if your intent was to destroy the airline.

    "[] White House chief of staff Mark Meadows sharply criticized President Trump's sister and niece on Sunday, a day after the Washington Post published leaked audio recordings of conversations of the two Trump relatives insulting the president. “I can tell you that I’ve never met the judge,” Meadows said of Trump’s sister, retired federal Judge Maryanne Trump Barry. “I was at [Robert Trump’s] funeral the other day. I was hoping to meet her there. She didn’t show up for her brother’s funeral.” Of Trump’s niece, Meadows said: “This is politics as usual by a niece that was written out of a will, that would apparently just [have] an ax to grind because she wants Joe Biden to be president.” Meadows made the comments during an interview on ABC’s “This Week,” where he was asked about the recordings, which the Post said it obtained from Trump’s niece Mary Trump. The recordings were reportedly made in 2018 and 2019, when Barry was still a federal judge. “I’m talking too freely, but you know. The change of stories, the lack of preparation, the lying, the holy s***!” Barry said in the recordings, in which she also called the president “cruel” and a “man with no principles.” NEW: White House chief of staff Mark Meadows responds to Maryanne Trump’s criticism of President Trump, telling @GStephanopoulos, “Obviously, he’s been public with his response. Just another day and another attack that we continue to see.” https://t.co/LcCZLVkoXR pic.twitter.com/6ad56MxzQ5 — This Week (@ThisWeekABC) August 23, 2020 The leaked audio is striking, as Barry has leveled almost no public criticisms against her brother. Mary Trump, on the other hand, has denounced her uncle and recently published a critical book: “Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man.” Mary Trump, a clinical psychologist, is the daughter of President Trump's brother Fred Trump Jr., who died in 1981 at the age of 42. The president’s other brother, Robert Trump, died earlier this month at the age of 71. The funeral, which Meadows referred to during his ABC interview, was held at the White House on Friday. In a separate “Fox News Sunday” interview, Meadows again noted that Barry had missed the funeral. Family funerals were always a fraught affair in the Trump family, as Mary Trump recounts in her bestselling memoir. When her father died, the family patriarch, Fred Trump Sr., refused to follow the wishes of Mary, her brother and her mother, and scatter his ashes near Montauk, N.Y., where he loved to fish and boat; instead he was buried in the family mausoleum in Queens. At Fred’s own funeral, attended by more than 800 people including then-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who gave a eulogy, the speeches were mostly about “my grandfather’s material success, his ‘killer instinct,’ and his talent for saving a buck. Donald was the only one to deviate from the script. In a cringe-inducing turn, his eulogy devolved into a paean to his own greatness. It was so embarrassing that Maryanne later told her son not to allow any of her siblings to speak at her funeral.” President Trump has previously fired back at Mary Trump’s book, declaring in a July tweet that she was “a seldom-seen niece who knows little about me” and saying his own parents “couldn't stand her!” He’s had kinder public words for his sister. In a 2016 interview, he called Barry a \"very, very well-respected judge.” Additional contributions by Jerry Adler. _____ Read more from Yahoo News: You don't need the U.S. Postal Service to deliver your mail-in ballot Trump says children are 'almost immune' to COVID-19.

    "[] Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images; Clancy Morgan/Business Insider TikTok is suing the US government after President Trump signed an executive order banning US firms and citizens from doing business with its parent company ByteDance, arguing a lack of due process. TikTok also argued it shouldn't be treated in the same category as telecoms companies, alluding to the Trump admin's blacklisting of Chinese telco giant Huawei last year. The Trump administration has argued both Huawei and TikTok pose national security threats because of their Chinese roots. TikTok says it shouldn't be treated like a telecoms provider in terms of any theoretical threat it could pose, because it does not provide the hardware backbone to \"facilitate the digital economy,\" and it does not provide \"critical infrastructure and vital emergency services.\" Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. TikTok on Monday filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over President Trump's attempts to ban it in the US. The company's main argument is that the US government ignored its right to \"due process\" in implementing the executive order — but it also picks up on a finer detail. In the executive order signed August 6, Trump wrote that the action against TikTok owner ByteDance — in which he banned US companies from doing business with the Chinese firm — was a follow-on from a May 2019 executive order. That first executive order paved the way for Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei to be placed on a trade blacklist. In its lawsuit, TikTok argued that it couldn't possibly pose a threat in the same way a telco theoretically could. It did not name Huawei directly, but compared itself to telcos targeted by the May 2019 order. The argument echoes a CIA assessment reported in the New York Times on August 7, which found that TikTok is far less of a national security threat than Huawei. TikTok said it \"is not a telecommunications provider and it does not provide the types of technology and services contemplated by the 2019 executive order.\" \"Specifically, TikTok Inc. does not provide the hardware backbone to 'facilitate the digital economy,' and TikTok Inc. has no role in providing 'critical infrastructure and vital emergency services,'\" the lawsuit reads. The US argues that both Huawei and TikTok pose a national security threat because of their Chinese roots, and has accused both of providing US citizens' data to the Chinese government. Both companies have repeatedly denied sharing user data with China, and TikTok has said it stores all of its data on US servers. Both companies have also argued they have been targeted for geopolitical reasons as part of the US' wrangling with China, rather than because they pose a real privacy or security threat. Although the administration's messaging about TikTok has been largely to do with security, before signing the executive order Trump suggested he might ban TikTok as a way to punish China for the coronavirus. Trump signed a second order stipulating TikTok must divest its US business. Microsoft and Oracle have confirmed they are both bidding to acquire its US operations. The New York Times report said CIA analysts told the White House they had found no evidence of TikTok accessing user data. Analyses of the app's privacy policy and source code have indicated that it is no more invasive than other social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat. Senator Mark Warner told the Times that as an \"app that allows you to make funny videos,\" TikTok doesn't really compare to Huawei in terms of threat level. As a telecommunications firm, Huawei's business hinges around building key, real-world infrastructure with networks that underpin industries like manufacturing, agriculture, and energy. Some experts believe that Huawei could therefore infiltrate more critical structures than TikTok. \"It's much harder for an app to become part of essential communication infrastructure than for a provider of communication hardware,\" Prof. Eerke Boiten, expert in cybersecurity at De Monfort University, told Business Insider. Once social media apps reach a certain critical mass they may start to rival telcos in their domination of people's everyday lives, Boiten added. \"I suspect one reason that people don't abandon Facebook and WhatsApp, despite their many problems, is that a lot of social organising in practice now happens via those channels.\" Despite TikTok's meteoric rise, it doesn't yet rival Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram for user numbers. Statistics revealed in its filing show TikTok has 689 million monthly active users worldwide, whereas Facebook has 3.1 billion monthly active users across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, per its Q2 2020 regulatory filing.

    "[] In the lead-up to the Republican National Convention, the word was that the four-day event would adopt an optimistic tone to counter the Democrats' criticism of President Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. That rang true in the convention's opening video montage Monday night, which argued Trump's \"swift action saved lives\" and that he is now leading the United States to an economic recovery. Once the first round of speakers got up to the podium, however, the evening took a darker turn. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk called Trump the \"bodyguard of western civilization\" who was \"elected to protect our families, our loved ones, from the vengeful mob that wishes to destroy our way of life, our neighborhoods, schools, church, and values.\" Kirk was followed by elementary school teacher Rebecca Friedrichs and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), both of whom also painted a dystopian image of the U.S. Friedrichs accused teachers' unions of turning classrooms into \"war zones\" while Gaetz suggested if Democrats return to power they'll take away people's guns, empty prisons, and install MS-13 gang members as people's next door neighbors.  Meaning their viewers are missing this optimism: Democrats \"will disarm you, empty the prisons, lock you in your home, and invite MS-13 to live next door. And the defunded police aren’t on their way.\" — Philip Bump (@pbump) August 25, 2020 Optimism, so far: Charlie Kirk: Biden/Dem \"mob... wishes to destroy our way of life.\" Rebecca Friedrichs: teachers unions have \"morphed our schools into war zones.\" — Eli Stokols (@EliStokols) August 25, 2020 More stories from theweek.com\nBiden campaign tries to dunk on the Republican National Convention by parodying Simon & Garfunkel\nBlack Monday for the religious right\nDonald Trump Jr. reportedly thinks his dad is going to lose in November",

In fact, she almost never says anything publicly about her brother at all. But now, we're learning what she's been keeping to herself.\" Noah played some of the comments from Maryanne Trump Barry, covertly recorded in 2018 and 2019 by Mary Trump, her and the president's niece. \"Come on — are we living in the 12th season of a soap opera now? When in real life does a sister come out of nowhere to start a feud with the main character?\" he asked. \"You know things are bad for Trump when he's having a hard time wrangling the Trump vote. It's going to be hard to win independents and swing states when you're polling poorly with people you share parents with. And I've gotta say, this made me a fan of Trump's sister — not because she dislikes her brother, but because she's 83 years old and she apparently loves cussing. I just want to go out to dinner with her.\" He imagined Barry ordering for the table. The Late Show created its own, more flattering \"secret\" recording from another Trump sister, \"Donna\" Trump.

    "[] Republicans kicked off their national convention Monday by trying to radically recast President Trump’s failures in containing the coronavirus pandemic as triumphs and by painting an apocalyptic vision of America if Democratic nominee Joe Biden wins in November. With Trump significantly trailing Biden in national and battleground polls, a parade of elected Republican officials, activists and the president's eldest son, Donald Jr., sought to lure back suburban and independent voters by trying to erase the president's perceived deficits of empathy and competence. But the program was marked by a dissonance between the upbeat, revisionist appeals and the dark, hyperbolic visions that repeatedly warned that Biden would champion socialism and lawlessness while Trump would stand, as one speaker put it, as a \"bodyguard\" who would protect America. Trump's campaign had promised an uplifting tone, seeking to contrast it with a Democratic convention that the president's aides claimed was negative and overly critical of the country. But the kinder, gentler approach quickly fell by the wayside as the president warned in a midday speech to delegates that \"your American dream will be dead\" if Biden wins. \"They want no guns. They want no oil and gas, and they want no God,\" he said of Democrats. Strikingly, Republicans offered few expressions of grief with the families of the 177,000 Americans who have died of COVID-19, or the nearly 30 million who lost their jobs over the past six months. But the RNC spent ample time addressing the matter, aiming to turn a major liability into a political strength by portraying Trump's response to the pandemic as a smashing success. A West Virginia nurse praised Trump's response to the health crisis. A Montana business owner said a federal loan allowed her to keep her coffee shop. A Louisiana maxillofacial surgeon lauded Trump for removing FDA \"barriers\" to unproven therapeutics. And video clips of lawmakers praising Trump portrayed him as a leader \"who got everything right\" in responding to the pandemic, even though the U.S. caseload and death toll is the worst by far in the world. Trump appeared in two taped segments from the White House East Room interacting with seven first responders, most of whom praised his actions, and again later in a sit-down with six former hostages whose releases he had helped to negotiate. While several Black speakers defended Trump from allegations of racism, the night also featured a white St. Louis couple who were charged with felonies for drawing guns against Black Lives Matter protesters earlier this summer. They declared that only Trump could defend the suburbs. The night's final speaker, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate, tried to thread the needle between the grievance that has always animated Trump's core supporters and a conciliatory message that might expand his base. \"We don’t give into cancel culture, or the radical — and factually baseless — belief that things are worse today than in the 1860s or the 1960s,\" Scott said. He lauded Trump for signing criminal justice reform and blasted Biden for supporting the 1994 crime bill that dramatically increased the country's prison population. Echoing other speakers, Scott claimed that Biden, who Democrats accused of being too close to the banking industry, and his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, would turn the United States \"into a socialist utopia.\" Donald Trump Jr., the scion and heir apparent to some of the most incendiary aspects of his father's politics, framed the election as \"shaping up to be church, work and school versus rioting, looting and vandalism.\" And his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, the ex-wife of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, gave one of the loudest and most expressive speeches, holding up the state as a cartoon example of a dystopian America. \"If you want to see the socialist Biden-Harris future for our country, just take a look at California,\" she said. \"It is a place of immense wealth, immeasurable innovation and immaculate environment — and the Democrats turned it into a land of discarded heroin needles in parks, riots in streets and blackouts in homes.\" At their convention, Democrats offered more air time to speakers reaching out to the political center than to its more progressive voices. On Monday, the Trump campaign seemed determined to animate its base with narrower appeals, reflecting not just two competing strategic views of the race but the polarity of the two candidates' approaches to politics. In speech after speech, Trump backers eschewed any clear articulation of a second-term agenda, arguing instead that only the president can save the nation from Biden and the \"radical\" Democrats they claim will control him if he is elected. In many ways, it was the mirror image of the Democrat’s main case for Biden: He is not Trump. Earlier Monday, the president unofficially accepted his party's nomination for reelection by delivering an unscripted, tradition-busting and falsehood-riddled speech in Charlotte, N.C., where the scaled-down convention kicked off. He taunted his enemies, suggesting that he might stay in office beyond the constitutional two-term limit. “If you want to really drive ‘em crazy, you say 12 more years,” Trump said to cheers from the 336 Republican delegates in the Charlotte Convention Center. Trump also accused Democrats of trying to \"steal the election\" by urging Americans to vote absentee to limit exposure to the coronavirus at polling places. Trump has long sought to sow doubt in the electoral process in case he loses, but doing so at a presidential nominating convention, which normally celebrates the virtues of voting, marked another unprecedented turn. “Be very careful and watch it very carefully because we have to win,” he added, falsely claiming that mail-in voting systems were being used to perpetuate fraud. \"It’s not fair and it's not right and it's not going to be possible to tabulate, in my opinion.\" Polls show widespread disapproval of Trump's management of the pandemic, but in Charlotte on Monday he accused Democrats of taking advantage of COVID-19. \"They're using COVID to steal an election,\" he said. \"They're using COVID to defraud the American people.\" Traditionally, presidential nominees do not speak extensively until the final night of a political convention. Trump plans to speak every day, and then give his formal acceptance speech before an invited crowd on the South Lawn of the White House on Thursday. Four years after party insiders resisted his insurgent campaign, Trump's dominance of the GOP appeared all but total. He faced no challengers for the nomination, and the GOP said Sunday that it would not update its official platform from 2016, explaining that \"the Republican Party has and will continue to support\" Trump's earlier agenda. But in a sign of how toxic Trump remains in much of the country, only one of the six most vulnerable Republican senators seeking reelection in swing states this fall, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, is scheduled to take the convention stage this week. Unlike the Democratic roll call last week, which presented a country-crossing mosaic highlighting America's diverse population and varied landscapes, the Republican delegates — nearly all of whom were white — attended the convention in person and spoke in front of a white backdrop featuring the convention hashtag. Many of their declarations even mimicked the president's hyperbole and mendacity: An Arkansas delegate reveled in Trump's 2016 win over \"Crooked Hillary,\" while one from Louisiana later claimed that Biden was \"waiting in the dark, wanting to take the lives of our unborn babies.\" Some RNC speakers Monday evening sought to soften Trump's image to the national television audience, if only to counter the Democrats' portrayal of Biden as empathetic and decent. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) described how Trump consoled his family after a loved one was killed. And former NFL star and \"The Apprentice\" contestant Herschel Walker directly addressed the notion that Trump, who has denigrated cities, attacked athletes for kneeling in protest of police brutality and refused to denounce a 2017 white supremacist march in Charlottesville, is a racist. \"Growing up in the Deep South, I have seen racism up close,\" Walker said. \"I know what it is. And it isn’t Donald Trump.\" Vernon Jones, a Black state lawmaker from Georgia, also made the case for Trump, claiming that Democrats take Black voters for granted. And Nikki Haley, an Indian American who is the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, declared that, despite the country's imperfections, \"America is not a racist country.\" The Biden campaign was quick to fire back that the limited RNC lineup showed the president's dwindling support, even in his own party. \"While nearly half of the speakers you will hear from are members of the Trump family, you aren't going to hear much about the plight of American families,\" said Kate Bedingfield, a Biden spokeswoman. She also seized on Trump's attempts to blame recent civil unrest on Democrats, noting that, in his campaign ads, Trump \"likes to make this argument about what life will look like in Joe Biden's America while quite literally using footage from Donald Trump's America.\" Times staff writer Mark Z. Barabak in San Francisco contributed to this report.",
    "[] Associated Press Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan took the stage at the Republican National Convention and delivered a speech full of misinformation and falsehoods. He also accused Democratic lawmakers of letting \"crime, violence, and mob rule\" run rampant. \"Democrats refuse to denounce the mob and their response to the chaos? Defund the police, defund border patrol, and defund our military. And while they're doing all this, they're also trying to take away your guns,\" he said. Jordan also accused the Obama administration of masterminding the Russia investigation to sabotage Trump and suggested Democrats hyped up the coronavirus pandemic to hurt Trump's reelection chances. Jordan is one of President Donald Trump's biggest attack dogs on Capitol Hill and often makes headlines for hijacking congressional hearings to spread conspiracy theories. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Ohio congressman Jim Jordan took the stage at the Republican National Convention on Monday and delivered a speech filled with falsehoods, accusing Democratic lawmakers of letting \"crime, violence, and mob rule\" run rampant. \"Look at what's happening in American cities. Cities all run by Democrats. Crime, violence, and mob rule,\" Jordan said. \"Democrats refuse to denounce the mob and their response to the chaos? Defund the police, defund border patrol, and defund our military. And while they're doing all this, they're also trying to take away your guns.\" Although several left-wing activists and progressive lawmakers have supported calls to \"defund the police,\" top Democrats and establishment figures like Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer have rejected the proposal. Vox also recently examined Biden's criminal justice policy and found that his plan would \"actually increase the number of police officers in Black and brown communities.\" \"Look at the positions they've taken in the past few months,\" Jordan said on Monday. \"Democrats won't let you go to church, but they'll let you protest. Democrats won't let you go to work, but they'll let you riot. Democrats won't let you go to school, but they'll let you loot.\" He also accused \"the swamp\" of masterminding the \"Russia hoax\" and the Mueller investigation to sabotage Trump. \"In spite of this unbelievable opposition, this president has said what he would do,\" Jordan said. Jordan, Trump, and other prominent Republicans have repeatedly accused the previous administration and senior officials at the FBI and DOJ of launching the Russia probe to undermine Trump's candidacy during the 2016 election; of illegally \"unmasking\" the name of former national security adviser Michael Flynn in US intelligence reports; and of improperly spying on the Trump campaign, which the president and his allies dubbed \"Spygate.\" A Washington Post report in May blew the \"Obamagate\" conspiracy to pieces when it revealed that Flynn's name was never \"masked\" in the first place. An internal investigation into the origins of the Russia probe by the DOJ's watchdog Michael Horowitz uncovered no evidence that the bureau illegally surveilled the Trump campaign. Horowitz also concluded that the FBI had sufficient basis to launch the investigation and that it was not politically motivated. The internal probe did, however, fault the FBI for making significant mistakes and errors in judgment in its application for a surveillance warrant to monitor the communications of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. And it criticized the bureau for partially relying on the unverified Steele dossier to support its warrant application. Jordan is one of President Donald Trump's biggest attack dogs on Capitol Hill and often makes headlines for hijacking congressional oversight hearings to push misinformation. At one House antitrust hearing late last month, Jordan suggested Google was secretly manipulating its search features to give the 2020 Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, an edge over Trump ahead of the November election. After Jordan was done with his questioning, Democratic Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania said, \"I'd like to redirect your attention to antitrust law rather than fringe conspiracy theories.\" Jordan erupted at his colleague, saying, \"We have the email,\" presumably referring to an email that was leaked to Fox News in which Google's former head of multicultural market expressed support for increasing Latinx voter turnout. The Ohio congressman has also joined Trump in downplaying the severity of the coronavirus outbreak and suggested Democrats are intentionally overhyping the pandemic to harm Trump's political prospects.

    "[] The first night of the Republican convention was always destined to be, in part, an attempt to whitewash much of the administration’s record on the COVID-19 pandemic. And the first hour showed just how committed the GOP is to the task—offering up a mix of glossy videos and disinformation packaged in a variety of formats. Several video montages praised the president for taking decisive action, presenting the deaths of more than 175,000 Americans as an achievement worth celebrating, if only because it could have been much worse. The content was not tethered to reality. It ignored the happy talk that the president has spouted about the virus going away. And it touted the administration’s handling of protective equipment for health-care workers when, in fact, states had warned for months at its slow arrival. It asserted that a ban on traveling to and from China saved millions of lives when scientists have said that the strand that hit the United States came from Europe. But the most remarkable moment came after the videos had ended, when the programming cut to a conversation Trump had with a group of essential workers about their lives during the pandemic. The format was conversational, and presented Trump in a more affable light than virtually anything he has done in months. But the content was also rife with problematic and misleading messaging. The people were not social distancing. Nor were they wearing masks. That may be because they were at the White House, where attendees must be tested before meeting with the president. And yet, when the conversation started, Trump claimed that a woman who had contracted COVID-19 in March was now perfectly safe. “We don’t have to be afraid of you at all,” he joked, despite no conclusive scientific evidence about how COVID survivors can transmit the virus. And he pushed hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma—two therapies whose efficacies range between marginal and dubious. Trump then offered that he took zinc and the antibiotic azithromycin as a preventative measure, neither of which are confirmed as helpful in warding off the virus. Read more at The Daily Beast.

    "[] The theme of the first night of the Republican National Convention was “America, Land of Promise,” a hopeful message belied by speeches that warned of impending national collapse if Donald Trump isn’t reelected in November. Here are the key takeaways from day one of the RNC: Many of the speakers on Monday echoed the strident, often divisive tone regularly employed by the president in portraying Democrats as godless anarchists, socialists and appeasers. The praise for Trump, meanwhile, was as effusive as that offered for Joe Biden a week earlier, with the president’s reelection cast as the country’s only hope for survival. “Democrats refuse to denounce the mob,” said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. “They’re also trying to take away your guns. “Democrats won’t let you go to church, but they’ll let you protest,” Jordan said. “Democrats won’t let you go to work, but they’ll let you riot. Democrats won’t let you go to school, but they’ll let you loot.” Shouting from the podium into an empty room, Kimberly Guilfoyle, the former Fox News personality who is dating Donald Trump, Jr., said Democrats “want to destroy this country, and everything that we have fought for and hold dear. They want to steal your liberty, your freedom. They want to control what you see and think and believe, so they can control how you live. They want to enslave you to the weak, dependent, liberal, victim ideology, to the point that you will not recognize this country or yourself.” When it was his turn, Donald Trump Jr., author of the book “Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us,” alternated between a more hopeful vision of American greatness and a seething contempt of those that he said were standing in the way of it. “Joe Biden is basically the Loch Ness Monster of the swamp. For the past half-century, he’s been lurking around in there. He sticks his head up every now and then to run for president, then he disappears and doesn’t do much in between,” said Trump, glossing over Biden’s two terms as vice president. He continued: “Joe Biden and the radical left are also now coming for our freedom of speech and want to bully us into submission. If they get their way, it will no longer be the ‘silent majority,’ it will be the ‘silenced majority.’” The elephant in the room at Monday’s convention, so to speak, was the more than 177,000 Americans who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. The death toll went unmentioned, as did the number of Americans who have contracted the virus, approaching 6 million. In a taped segment introducing a panel of health care workers and first responders, Trump made clear that he believes he bears no blame for the number of Americans who have perished or been infected by the virus. “These are the incredible workers that helped us so much with the COVID. We can call it many different things, from China virus, I don’t want to go through all the names, because some people may get insulted, but that’s the way it is.” Later, Trump Jr. said the virus had come to the U.S. “courtesy of the Chinese Communist Party.” A taped montage showed Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, downplaying the threat of COVID-19 early in the outbreak, and Democratic governors, including Andrew Cuomo of New York and Phil Murphy of New Jersey, thanking Trump for his assistance in fighting the pandemic — something Trump explicitly made a condition of disbursing federal help. A registered nurse from West Virginia who relocated to New York in April to help fight the virus, Amy Johnson Ford, denounced Cuomo, saying, “His lack of action made my job treating patients who had their worlds turned upside down that much harder.” By contrast, “President Trump recognized the threat this virus presented for all Americans early on, and made rapid policy changes,” Ford said. “And as a result, telehealth services are now accessible to more than 71 million Americans, including 35 million children.” (Trump in fact has predicted repeatedly that the coronavirus would miraculously disappear on its own.) Dr. G.E. Ghali, a Louisiana physician who contracted COVID-19, praised Trump’s handling of the pandemic. “A prompt response led by President Trump cleared away the red tape that usually makes drug approvals a long and drawn-out process,” Ghali said. “By harnessing the resources of the federal government and the private sector, President Trump’s ‘Operation Warp Speed’ is accelerating the testing, supply, development and distribution of therapeutics, diagnostics, and very shortly, effective vaccines to counter COVID-19.” At last week’s Democratic National Convention, Joe Biden was contrasted with Trump in terms of both policy and character. Biden, who suffered the loss of his first wife and daughter in a 1972 car accident and the death of his son to cancer in 2015, was hailed as a person of empathy whose human connection helps to guide the decisions he makes. Republicans insisted on Monday that compassion was one of Trump’s defining virtues. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of Trump’s staunchest supporters in Congress, segued from an especially harsh attack on Democrats to a heartwarming recounting of the compassion shown by the president upon learning that Jordan’s nephew had died. “It was a Saturday morning, three days after the accident. I was walking to the car, to go to Eli’s parents’ home, when the president called,” Jordan said. “We talked about a few issues. And then he asked how the family was doing. I said, ‘They’re doing OK, but it’s tough.’ The president said ‘Yeah. Losing a loved one’s always difficult, and it’s really tough when they’re so young.’ I then said, ‘Mr. President, I’m actually walking into their house right now. Obviously, they don’t know I’m talking to you. But if you’d be willing to say hello to Eli’s dad, you’d make a terrible day a little less terrible.’ ‘What’s his name?’ the president asked. I walked through the door, and said, ‘Todd, the president wants to talk to you.’” Rep. Steve Scalise, himself the victim of a gunshot attack in Washington, D.C., also hailed a side of Trump that is rarely on display on Twitter or at his campaign events. “I’ve worked closely with Donald Trump over the last few years, and if there’s one constant theme to how he approaches problems, it’s how much he cares about the hard-working people that Washington left behind,” Scalise said. “I’ve seen this firsthand. After I was shot on a baseball field by a leftist gunman, first responders rushed me to a hospital, where I battled for my life. That same night, Donald Trump came to the hospital, along with first lady Melania Trump. They consoled my wife, Jennifer. They were there for my family in my darkest hours. Donald Trump would call to check on me throughout the following weeks, just to see how I was doing. That’s the kind of person he is. That’s the side of Donald Trump that the media will never show you.” Trump’s hospital visit to Scalise was, in fact, widely reported in the mainstream media. Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, President Trump’s pitch to Black voters was summed up in the line: “What the hell do you have to lose?” But Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police seemed to present an easy answer to that question, and to have made Trump’s play for support from African-American voters an uphill struggle. Still, Monday’s convention included a number of compelling speeches from Black supporters. Former N.F.L. running back and Heisman Trophy winner Herschel Walker has a long history with the president and appeared as a cast member on the second season of Trump’s TV show “Celebrity Apprentice.” “It hurts my soul to hear the terrible names that people call Donald. The worst one is ‘racist.’ I take it as a personal insult that people would think I would have a 37-year friendship with a racist,” Walker said on Monday. “People who think that don’t know what they are talking about. Growing up in the Deep South, I have seen racism up close. I know what it is. And it isn’t Donald Trump.” Kim Klacik, a Republican candidate for Congress in Maryland’s Seventh District, lashed out at Biden over comments he made during a radio interview with a Black host, in which the former vice president quipped,“If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t Black.” Biden later apologized for the remark. “Joe Biden believes we can’t think for ourselves: that the color of someone’s skin dictates their political views,” Klacik said. “We’re not buying the lies anymore. You and your party have ignored us for too long.” Georgia state Rep. Vernon Jones, the only Democrat to appear at the convention in support of Trump, echoed Klacik’s remarks. “The Democratic Party does not want Black people to leave the mental plantation they've had us on for decades,” Jones said. “But I have news for them: We are free people with free minds. I am part of a large and growing segment of the Black community who are independent thinkers. And we believe that Donald Trump is the president that America needs to lead us forward.” But Jones overstated his case, giving Trump credit for ending the “policy of incarcerating Black people,” by signing the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform measure, into law. Joining the pile-on was Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who was put in charge of the Republican legislative response to what lawmakers, for a time, seemed to agree was a widespread problem of systemic police racism. “Joe Biden said Black people are a monolithic community,” Scott said, referring to another interview in which Biden was contrasting Hispanic Americans with Blacks. Despite these dissenting views, an average of polls of African-American voters through July showed Biden leading Trump by a margin of 83 percent to 8 percent. Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, showed why many Republicans believe that she is the future of her party, delivering a strong speech that, while hammering Biden for what she called his socialist views, also told an American success story. “In much of the Democratic Party, it’s now fashionable to say that America is racist. That is a lie. America is not a racist country,” Haley said. “This is personal for me. I am the proud daughter of Indian immigrants that came to America and settled in a small Southern town. My father wore a turban. My mother wore a sari. I was a brown girl in a black and white world. We faced discrimination and hardship, but my parents never gave in to grievance and hate. My mom built a successful business. My dad taught 30 years at a historically Black college. And the people of South Carolina chose me as their first minority and first female governor.” While rumors circulated in the lead-up to the convention that Trump might ditch Mike Pence and name Haley as his running mate for the 2020 election, that didn’t happen. Her speech on Monday, however, boosted Haley’s prospects of rising to the top of the Republican Party. _____ Read more from Yahoo News: You don't need the U.S. Postal Service to deliver your mail-in ballot 'I trusted them.'

    "[] TikTok on Monday sued the Trump administration, declaring that the president's executive order against the popular video app and its Chinese parent company is unconstitutional. President Trump signed an executive order earlier this month that would bar TikTok's parent company, China-based ByteDance, from doing business with American businesses starting on Sept. 20. The vague order could cause companies such as Apple and Google to pull TikTok from mobile app stores, block brands from placing ads on TikTok and potentially stop ByteDance from paying its U.S. employees, legal experts said. That has caused uncertainty among TikTok's more than 1,500 U.S. employees and panic among some of its video creators. TikTok said Trump's order \"has the potential to strip the rights of that community without any evidence to justify such an extreme action and without any due process,\" the company said in a statement Monday. \"We do not take suing the government lightly, however we feel we have no choice but to take action to protect our rights, and the rights of our community and employees.\" The lawsuit, filed by TikTok and ByteDance in federal court in Los Angeles, names as defendants Trump, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec declined to comment. TikTok is under immense pressure as politicians in India, U.S. and Japan have raised concerns that ByteDance could be compelled to give user data to the Chinese government. India has banned the app over such national security concerns, while Trump said he would support the sale of TikTok's U.S. operations to an American company such as Microsoft, if some of the proceeds from the acquisition went to the U.S. Treasury Department. Microsoft has confirmed it is in discussions with ByteDance and that talks will conclude by Sept. 15. Other potential TikTok suitors include tech companies Twitter and Oracle. The executive order, signed Aug. 6, threatens to end TikTok's thriving business in the U.S., where it has become a key player in the entertainment industry and is used by 100 million Americans. Music artists and labels leverage the app's creators to promote their songs, talent agencies use it to discover new talent and there are dozens of L.A. digital stars that make a living on TikTok through brand deals. Globally, TikTok has exploded in popularity, with 689.1 million monthly active users in July of this year — up from nearly 55 million in January 2018 — the company said in its lawsuit. \"The order is very vague and ambiguous,\" said Bryan Sullivan, a partner at law firm Early Sullivan Wright Gizer and McRae. \"It does not provide any detail whatsoever as to the scope of the order and how far it would be applied.\" Trump issued the order under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives him the authority to regulate international commerce to address unusual or extraordinary threats, Sullivan said. Trump said in his order that TikTok's \"data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information — potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.\" TikTok said it has worked with the government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States for nearly a year and believes its app does not threaten national security. The company said the U.S. government did not provide evidence that it was an actual threat and has maintained that it has not given and will not give information to the Chinese government. \"The order is thus a gross misappropriation of IEEPA (International Emergency Economic Powers Act) authority and a pretext for furthering the President’s broader campaign of anti-China rhetoric in the run-up to the U.S. election,\" the company said in its lawsuit. TikTok has said that U.S. user data are stored in Virginia and backed up in Singapore and that it plans to open a transparency and accountability center in Culver City, where outside experts can see the code that powers the app's algorithm and learn about how it moderates content. On another legal front, TikTok technical program manager Patrick Ryan filed a separate lawsuit against Trump and Ross on behalf of the company's U.S. employees, who are concerned they will not be able to receive a paycheck because of Trump's order. Ryan's lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court in San Francisco, also raises concerns for TikTok employees who are on H-1B visas and may have to leave the country if their jobs are terminated. \"It would have a significant impact because we have an employer that wants to pay us and we've done nothing wrong as employees and the order prohibits this,\" Ryan said. Mike Godwin, Ryan's attorney, said his client has a strong case. \"It's very rare to see those powers used to essentially destroy a company and deprive employees of the right to be paid — lawful employees have the right to be paid,\" Godwin said. The lawsuit also suggests that Trump may be targeting TikTok because some of its users had ordered tickets to attend a Trump rally in Tulsa with no plans to show up, causing attendance to be less than expected. Trump also issued a second executive order Aug. 14 against ByteDance, requiring the company to divest its TikTok U.S. operations by Nov. 12. The best outcome for TikTok would be a finding that Trump's order is unconstitutional, but it could take months for the case to be resolved, Sullivan said. The clock would not stop on Trump's order unless a judge grants a temporary injunction, he added. “This is brutal for a lot of people who work at the company, who want to use what they learned to contribute to a great platform,” said Zhengqin Luo, an engineering manager at TikTok's Mountain View office, adding that the company has drawn top talent in engineering in the Bay Area. “It’s sad for me to see this happening, for employees to have to bring a lawsuit .” Meanwhile, rival companies such as L.A.-based Triller, which operates a music video app, have gone on the offensive, poaching TikTok staff and some of its popular creators. For example, Raj Mishra, former head of strategy at ByteDance, has joined Triller as head of India operations. The uncertainty is causing panic among some TikTok creators, who have urged fans to follow them on alternate video platforms including YouTube and Instagram. Several digital stars defected to Triller and joined as investors. Instagram earlier this month launched its own short-form video feature, Reels, which TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer called a \"copycat product.\" To fend off rivals, TikTok announced the first 19 recipients of its $200-million U.S. creator fund. At least one creator received a six-figure deal over a year, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to be named. The company plans to grow the fund to $1 billion in the next three years. This investment has helped quell some of the anxiety among TikTok creators, many of whom rely on brand deals and promotions for their livelihoods. Marketers have been working with TikTok stars to reach young audiences who spend lots of time on the app. Some brands have clauses in their contracts that if a TikTok ban were to happen, the content would be posted on Instagram instead, said Amy Neben, a partner at Los Angeles-based Select Management Group. \"If you're not diversifying, you definitely have your head in the clouds,\" Neben said. \"None of the creators own any of these products, so it's really on you to own your audience and to be able to pivot them.\" But TikTok executives maintain that the company plans to be around for a long time and that it continues to have the support of creators and employees. \"Our employees have the benefit of hearing and seeing what we're working on, our commitment to our users,\" Vanessa Pappas, TikTok U.S. general manager, said at the Vox virtual event \"Pivot Schooled\" earlier this month. \"We're attracting amazing talent every day.\"",
    "[] CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The first night of the Republican National Convention offered a sweeping defense of President Donald Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic and depicted Democrats as a threat to an America engulfed in national protests. \"From a global pandemic to the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, 2020 has tested our nation in ways we haven't seen for decades,\" said Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. \"Make no mistake: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want a cultural revolution. A fundamentally different America. If we let them, they will turn our country into a socialist utopia.\" The backdrop for Trump's convention: an America in turmoil as the pandemic rages and protests continue calling for an end to racial injustice. The convention pulled frequently at those threads, bouncing between praising the federal response to the coronavirus and casting Democrats as socialists who would stoke racial animosity and allow riots to rage. \"They put political correctness ahead of the safety and security of the American people,\" Donald Trump Jr. said. \"Anarchists have been flooding our streets, and Democrat mayors are ordering the police to stand down.\" Republicans tried to counter Trump critics who say the president is a racist, inviting supporters of diverse backgrounds to speak and offering a different portrait of the country than one plagued by systemic racism. Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, considered a likely candidate to run for president as a Republican in 2024, defended America's racial dynamics, offering a personal story of her immigrant parents. \"In much of the Democratic Party, it's now fashionable to say that America is racist. That is a lie. America is not a racist country,\" Haley said. \"America is a story that's a work in progress. Now is the time to build on that progress and make America even freer, fairer and better for everyone. That's why it's tragic to see so much of the Democratic Party turn a blind eye toward riots and rage.\" Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate, credited his political success in part to \"the evolution of the Southern heart.\" \"In an overwhelmingly white district, the voters judged me not the color of my skin, but the content of my character,\" Scott said of his first run for Congress. Former NFL running back Herschel Walker, who is Black, said it \"hurt my soul\" to hear Trump being called a racist. \"Growing up in the Deep South, I've seen racism up close. I know what it is. And it isn't Donald Trump,\" Walker said. Democratic state Rep. Vernon Jones of Georgia, a Trump supporter who is Black, condemned his party for taking Black voters for granted, saying, \"The Democratic Party does not want Black people to leave their mental plantation.\" The messages were contrasted with those of guests who depicted protesters, most of whom are Black, as violent and dangerous, warning that Democrats would usher in more unrest. \"Democrats no longer view the government's job as protecting honest citizens from criminals but rather protecting criminals from honest citizens,\" said Mark McCloskey, who along with his wife, Patricia McCloskey, gained national attention when they pointed guns at Black Lives Matter protesters marching past their home in St. Louis. Patricia McCloskey said: \"So make no mistake: No matter where you live, your family will not be safe in the radical Democrats' America. What you saw happen to us could just as easily happen to any of you watching from quiet neighborhoods around the country.\" Throughout the evening, Republicans also sought to depict the pandemic in an optimistic tone, touting medical treatments and detailing the response overseen by the federal government. A series of videos showed cheering health care workers and a nation in recovery, with no mention of the almost 180,000 people who have died. \"Just imagine what 2020 would've looked like, fighting for your life, without Donald Trump fighting for it, too,\" said Natalie Harp of California, who talked about battling a rare cancer. \"In January, there'd have been no China travel ban. Millions would've died. Millions more would've been infected — for there'd be no record levels of testing.\" The president entered his convention trailing Democratic rival Joe Biden in the polls, and he faces a torrent of criticism for his administration's handling of the pandemic. This week's convention will be his most aggressive attempt yet to turn the national sentiment in his favor. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, sought to present a softer side of Trump, sharing a story about how the president took time to speak to his family after his nephew died in a car crash two years ago. \"Democrats won't let you go to church, but they'll let you protest,\" Jordan said. \"Democrats won't let you go to work, but they'll let you riot. Democrats won't let you go to school, but they'll let you loot. President Trump has fought against their crazy ideas.\" Trump, who is scheduled to appear every night of the convention, met with first responders at the White House in a recorded video to discuss their experiences with the coronavirus. Trump appeared again later in the evening in another video recorded from the White House with six hostages who were rescued from foreign captivity during his administration. Democrats hosted their convention last week, conducting the event almost entirely remotely and getting high praise for its production value. The Republican convention will feature videos, but it will conclude each night with a more traditional format featuring a series of speakers on a single stage. Download the NBC News app for alerts and all the latest on the Republican convention. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., one of Trump's most fervent defenders, mocked Biden for not holding more events outside of his home during the pandemic. \"I'm speaking from an auditorium emptier than Joe Biden's daily schedule,\" Gaetz said. Gaetz called a Biden administration a \"horror movie.\" \"They'll disarm you, empty the prisons, lock you in your home and invite MS-13 to live next door,\" Gaetz said. \"And the defunded police aren't on their way.\" CORRECTION (Aug. 24, 2020, 7:10 p.m. ET): A photo caption on a previous version of this article misidentified Tim Scott's congressional position.

    "[] Refresh often for updates throughout Day 2 of the RNC. WASHINGTON – Republicans sought to strike a more hopeful tone during the second night of their national convention Tuesday, featuring members of President Donald Trump’s family – including first lady Melania Trump – and placing an emphasis on the less controversial aspects of the president’s first term. “It has been inspiring to see what the people of our great nation will do for one another, especially when we are at our most fragile,” the first lady said in an address from the Rose Garden where the president joined a live audience watching and -- in a rare occurrence during the pandemic -- applauding her remarks. The first lady focused much of her speech on what she described as the American spirit to overcome crisis, from COVID-19 to natural disasters. She steered widely clear of both policy arguments and political attacks on Democrat Joe Biden. “The common thread in all of these challenging situations is the unwavering resolve to help one another,” Melania Trump said in address that also touched on mental health and addiction with a weight few others have given to those issues. That softer approach was set before the first lady walked onto the podium in the historic garden that was recently renovated under her direction.  Unlike the convention’s opening night, most speakers Tuesday focused their fire on Biden’s policies – particularly his desire to roll back Trump’s tax cuts on high earners -- rather than on dark premonitions of “socialism” or the “destruction” of suburbs. “Americans are going back to work,” said Larry Kudlow, one of Trump’s top economic advisers. “There’s a housing boom. There’s an auto boom, a manufacturing boom, a consumer spending boom.” Speakers sought to tout the progress made confronting the economic crisis without offering proposals for dealing with the current dramatic increase in unemployment. Many featured speakers, including the first lady, discussed the coronavirus in broad terms, arguing that the president “would not rest” until a vaccine or therapy had approved to treat the illness. Lara Brown, director of George Washington University’s Graduate School of Political Management, noted that some Republicans spoke as if COVID-19 was already in the past and the economy had already recovered. \"Both of those descriptions about the present moment and near future seem disconnected from the reality that most Americans are experiencing,\" Brown said. The Republican convention started Tuesday with a recognition of the high-profile shooting in Wisconsin of Jacob Blake, a Black man shot in the back by police in an incident that has aired for days on cable news. The convention’s opening prayer, offered by a Las Vegas minister, called for “healing and comfort” for Jacob Blake. Trump himself made two remarkable appearances: Formally pardoning Jon Ponder, a Las Vegas man who helps ex-prisoners re-enter society, and leading a naturalization ceremony for five new U.S. citizens. Both highly unusual events were criticized by Democrats as a questionable use of presidential authority during a political event. Liz Mair, a Republican strategist and Trump critic, wondered if the president delayed the pardon so that it would coincide with the convention. \"The main thing I find troubling is that Trump knew Jon Ponder, knew his story, knew of his good works, and didn’t get around to pardoning him until today,\" she said. But they also set a far different message than Trump’s usual rhetoric on immigration:  Trump’s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign, was barely raised at all. Neither were his efforts to limit legal immigration through unilateral changes to asylum and visa programs. \"Congratulations,” Trump told the group in a video the White House released hours before it played during the convention telecast. “Great going.\" Convention speakers touted the tax cut law Trump signed in 2017, the recent agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Israel. The convention featured a video noting the number of women Trump had appointed to top jobs in the White House, including the current and previous two White House press secretaries. The night was not entirely devoid of harsh criticism of Biden. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, in particular, used her remarks to attack the former vice president's son Hunter for his business dealings in Ukraine, revisiting an argument she raised during the president’s impeachment defense. “If they want to make this election a choice between who's been saving America and who's been swindling America, bring it on,” Bondi said. Nor did the convention’s second night go off without a hitch: Organizers had to pull a speaker from the lineup after she promoted anti-Semitic, QAnon conspiracy theory on Twitter. Mary Ann Mendoza -- an advocate for stricter immigration policies whose son was killed in accident by a driver who was an undocumented immigrant – was dropped shortly before the event got underway. But for the most part, the convention’s second night appeared to stick to a different script. “Donald is a husband that supports me in all that I do,” first lady Melania Trump said. “We will be honored to serve this incredible country for four more years.” -- John Fritze and David Jackson First Lady Melania Trump headlined the second night of the GOP convention with a keynote address from the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, opening her remarks by acknowledging the coronavirus pandemic and the devastation and anxiety it has caused across the country. “I want to acknowledge the fact that since March, our lives have changed drastically. The invisible enemy COVID-19 swept across our beautiful country and impacted all of us,” she said. “My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering.” “I know many people are anxious and some feel helpless. I want you to know. You are not alone,” she continued. “My husband's administration will not stop fighting until there is an effective treatment or vaccine available to everyone.” Are the trees gone?: Melania Trump did not remove cherry trees, historic roses from Rose Garden Trump’s homage to women’s suffrage and the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as part of the campaign’s wider effort to appeal to the crucial female voting bloc. A recent ABC/Washington Post poll found that Joe Biden leads Trump 56% to 40% in support among women. \"I reflected on the impact of women's voices in our nation's story and how proud I will be to cast my vote again for Donald, this November,\" she said. \"We must make sure that women are heard. And that American Dream continues to thrive.\" The first lady’s address is her biggest prime-time speech since the 2016 GOP convention, where she was accused of plagiarism after portions of her speech closely resembled parts of a 2008 speech by Michelle Obama. A Trump Organization employee later issued a statement taking responsibility for the similarities. Trump has mostly stayed out of the political spotlight as her husband has campaigned in recent months but used the address to highlight her favorite moments as the first lady. It also gave her a chance to showcase the renovations she oversaw of the Rose Garden though not without controversy. Delivering her speech from the Rose Garden, part of the official White House, raised ethical questions about whether it blurred the line between the government and the president’s re-election campaign. She also opened up about her experience of coming to the U.S. from Slovenia, even as her husband has sought to curb legal and illegal immigration. Trump said becoming a citizen was \"one of the proudest moments in my life, because with hard work and determination, I was able to achieve my own American dream.\" \"As an immigrant, and a very independent woman. I understand what a privilege is that we have,\" she said. \"There are no words to describe how honored humbled and fortunate I am to serve our nation as your first lady.\" — Courtney Subramanian Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron slammed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as “a backwards thinker” and suggested President Donald Trump could live up to the “mandate” of Abraham Lincoln. Cameron, the state’s first Black attorney general, blasted Biden for saying during a radio interview earlier this year that African Americans who don’t vote for him “ain’t black” and warning in 2012 that Republicans would put Blacks “back in chains.” “Joe Biden is a backwards thinker in a world craving forward-looking leadership,” Cameron said. “There’s no wisdom in his record or plan, just a trail of discredited ideas and offensive statements.” Cameron, a rising star in the Republican Party, has come under criticism from activists who want his office to speed up its investigation into the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who was fatally shot by police in her Louisville apartment in March. Her death has sparked protests across the country. In his remarks at the Republican National Convention, Cameron criticized anarchists who “mindlessly tear up American cities while attacking police officers and innocent bystanders.” Republicans “recognize those who earnestly strive for peace, justice, and equality,” he said. Cameron, who was raised just a few miles from Lincoln’s birthplace in Kentucky, said the nation’s 16th president – who is also the first Republican president – believed “the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present … and we must rise to the occasion.” “I believe President Trump can meet Lincoln’s mandate, even as Joe Biden remains trapped by his party’s radicals and his own failed record,” he said — Michael Collins Speaking from Israel while traveling on official government business, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Trump has “led bold initiatives in nearly every corner of the world” to secure peace and “keep us safe and our freedoms intact.” “It may not have made him popular in every foreign capital, but it’s worked,” Pompeo said in defense of Trump’s “America First” foreign policy that has alienated traditional U.S. allies, even as Trump courted foreign adversaries. He recorded his remarks during a stop in Jerusalem, part of a four-country diplomatic mission in the region. The State Department said Pompeo was speaking in his personal capacity, not as America’s chief diplomat. But Pompeo talked about policy decisions. The successes he touted included holding China accountable “for covering up the China virus,” killing Islamic State leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, lowering the temperature with North Korea, exiting the “disastrous nuclear deal with Iran” and moving the U.S. Embassy to “this very city of God, Jerusalem, the rightful capital of the Jewish homeland.” In 2017, Trump delivered on a campaign promise to break with decades of U.S. foreign policy and move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. That decision, among other pro-Israel policies, has helped bolster Trump’s support among evangelical voters, a pivotal constituency for the GOP. Pompeo’s remarks broke diplomatic protocol and perhaps the State Department's own policy on engaging in partisan political activity. Before he spoke, Rep. Joaquin Castro, a top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, opened a probe into Pompeo’s decision, saying he has \"a gross disregard\" for ethics rules and \"a blatant willingness to violate federal law for political gain.\" — Maureen Groppe and Deirdre Shesgreen Eric Trump, Trump’s third eldest son, joined a list of relatives who spoke or are slated to speak at the Republican convention. He used his remarks to tick off a list of his father’s accomplishments and echoed his brother, Donald Trump Jr., in painting a Joe Biden presidency as “the empty, oppressive and radical views of the extreme left.” “He is a career politician who has never signed the front of a check and does not know the slightest thing about the American worker or the American business,” Trump said. Like his brother, Eric Trump falsely claimed that Biden wants to defund the police, a call by some on the left to shift public resources from law enforcement agencies to social programs and public safety alternatives. Biden has said he does not back defunding police and instead called for additional funding for local police forces. Eric Trump rounded out his remarks by speaking directly to his father, saying he missed “working alongside you every day but I’m damn proud to be on the front lines of this fight.” Tiffany Trump, the fourth of the president’s five children and perhaps the least visible, offered a stinging critique of the media, technology companies and even the nation’s education system for promoting what she described as “groupthink” that stands in opposition to the president. “People must recognize that our thoughts, opinions, and even the choice of who we vote for may and are being manipulated and invisibly coerced by the media and tech giants,” said Tiffany Trump, who graduated from Georgetown Law this year. “If you tune into the media, you get one biased opinion or another.” Trump’s family was heavily represented on the second night of the convention at a difficult time: The president’s brother died of an undisclosed illness Aug. 15. President Trump has also been forced to contend with a critical book written by his niece, Mary Trump, and recorded audio of sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, ripping him for “phoniness” and “lying.” There was little indication of that strife on Tuesday, though. Tiffany Trump implored Americans to see “beyond the façade – the masks – that so many other politicians employ” and she urged voters to “make your judgment based on results and not rhetoric.” — John Fritze and Courtney Subramanian Marrying two key criminal justice messages often addressed by President Donald Trump, the Republican convention on Tuesday turned to an Albuquerque police officer who adopted the baby of a woman addicted to heroin. Ryan Holets recalled an incident in 2017 in which he approached a pregnant woman preparing to inject heroin. The woman confessed she seeking a family who would adopt her baby. \"God showed me exactly what I had to do,\" Holets said. \"Without hesitation, I told her that my family would adopt her baby.\" The story hit on several important themes for Trump: First, the president has frequently touted the importance of police in communities, even as some departments have come under criticism for high-profile deadly interactions with Black citizens. The story also spoke to an issue Trump has frequently discussed: The growth of opioid addiction in the U.S. Trump has signed several executive orders on the issue, and the administration has worked to reduce the number of opioids prescribed by doctors. \"I hold a special place in my heart for those facing opioid addiction,\" Holets said. \"That’s why I’m enormously grateful to the president for his leadership in fighting this deadly enemy.\" — John Fritze Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez, the first Latina in that post in state history, urged voters to support President Donald Trump to put “America first” in economic policy and for religious freedom. “Let us join our president in his vow that America will never be a socialist country,” said Nunez, whose parents fled Fidel Castro’s Cuba. “He’s defended our religious freedom, stood with democratic allies like Colombia, and shown unwavering resolve while confronting tyrants in countries like Venezuela, Cuba, China and Nicaragua.” She said Trump would support law enforcement. She said he would fight to provide the best quality education by preserving school choice. “Americans have a choice,” Nunez said. “We can go down a dark road of chaos and government control, or we can choose the path of freedom and opportunity that was paved by those who sacrificed everything to preserve the American Dream for future generations.” — Bart Jansen Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds credits President Donald Trump with helping her state recover from devastating floods and storms. When 100-year floods breached nearly all levees and devastated communities along the Missouri River in Iowa, Nebraska and Missouri last year, Trump approved their request for federal aid in record time – just two days, Reynolds said. And when a storm called a derecho, with hurricane-force winds of up to 140 miles per hour, wiped out millions of acres of crops just two weeks ago, Trump approved the state’s disaster aid request in less than 24 hours, she said. Trump “had our back,” said Reynolds, a Republican and Trump supporter. “The president cut through the bureaucracy to do what needed to be done, and to do it quickly,” she said. Iowa is expected to be a key battleground state in November’s election. Trump carried the state in 2016 by nearly 9.5 percentage points. But polls show him in a tight race with Democratic challenger Joe Biden this year. Trump leads Biden by just 1.7 percentage points in the Real Clear Politics average of state polls. — Michael Collins Surprisingly, President Donald Trump's impeachment came up at the Republican convention on Tuesday. Not surprisingly, a Republican lawyer used it to attack Joe Biden. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who helped Trump with his impeachment defense, used her speech to attack Joe Biden's son Hunter for his business dealings in Ukraine. \"Joe Biden says he'll build back better,\" Bondi said at one point. \"Yeah ... build the Biden's Back Better.\" Bondi provided no evidence that Hunter Biden's business activity in Ukraine was illegal, or that Biden himself acted improperly. Democrats quickly pointed out that Trump was impeached for pressuring Ukraine into investigating Biden, despite the lack of evidence, and for threatening to withhold military aid if it did not follow through. Steve Schmidt, a former Republican and now a Trump opponent, tweeted that Bondi is \"ethically challenged,\" and \"lying about the Biden Family and repeating the talking points of Russian Intelligence Services.\" Bondi has a close relationship with Trump, first as a long-time confidant from her days as attorney general and later as one of the lawyers who defended the president during the Senate impeachment trial earlier this year. She also faced heavy criticism in 2013 when a Trump foundation sent her campaign a $25,000 check around the time her office decided not to join a New York state probe of consumer complaints against Trump University. Bondi has repeatedly said the donation had nothing to do with a decision made by independent investigators in her office not to pursue the investigation. — David Jackson The QAnon conspiracy theory made its way to the Republican National Convention Tuesday. Shortly before the second night of programming began, Mary Ann Mendoza was pulled from the RNC lineup after earlier in the day retweeting an anti-Semitic Twitter thread with ties to the QAnon conspiracy theory. Mendoza tweeted “Do yourself a favor and read this thread,” linking to a lengthy thread from a QAnon conspiracy theorist that claimed the Rothschilds, a famous Jewish family from Germany, created a plan to terrorize “goyim” — non-Jewish people — by having \"the goyim destroy each other\" and “rob the goyim of their landed properties.” — Savannah Behrmann Larry Kudlow, the White House’s top economic adviser, says the U.S. economy is recovering from the coronavirus pandemic thanks to “a great bipartisan rescue” led by President Donald Trump. A tax hike would disrupt the recovery, he warned. The coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 178,000 Americans, has had a catastrophic impact on the U.S. economy since March. A mind-boggling 57.3 million workers have filed for unemployment over the past 22 weeks. Just two weeks ago, some 1.1 million Americans filed first-time applications for unemployment, the Labor Department said, signaling that the recovery will remain volatile. But Kudlow struck an upbeat tone in his remarks to the Republican National Convention. “Americans are going back to work,” Kudlow said. “There’s a housing boom. There’s an auto boom, a manufacturing boom, a consumer spending boom.” Looking ahead, the Trump administration is planning more tax cuts and regulatory relief for small businesses, Kudlow said. “Our economic choice is very clear,” Kudlow said. “Do you want economic health prosperity opportunity and optimism, or do you want to turn back to the dark days of stagnation recession and pessimism? There can’t be better economic policies than we’ve had in recent years.” — Michael Collins Republicans are working hard during the second night of the Republican convention to drive home a message about Democrat Joe Biden, arguing his administration would quickly increase taxes – as soon as Day 1. \"You're coming out of a pandemic, and he wants to raise taxes?\" asked Larry Kudlow, one of President Donald Trump’s top economic advisers. \"That's crazy.\" It was a theme that was repeatedly raised throughout the evening. John Peterson, owner a metal company, said Biden is \"ready to raise taxes, crush us with regulations.\" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said that Trump is the candidate to support for voters \"who want lower taxes.\" Biden has vowed to repeal the Trump tax cuts approved early in his presidency, but for top earners -- those earning over more than $400,000 – as well as corporations. If elected, Biden would need buy in from Congress to roll back the tax cuts, a move unlikely to take place on his first day. —John Fritze Abby Johnson, an anti-abortion advocate known for turning against Planned Parenthood after working as the director of a clinic, touted President Donald Trump’s anti-abortion agenda. “For me, abortion is real. I know what it sounds like; I know what abortion smells like. Did you know abortion even had a smell? I’ve been the perpetrator to these babies, to these women,” Johnson said on Tuesday. Johnson, author of the memoir “Unplanned” that was also adapted into a film, told the story of witnessing an abortion that changed her views on the issue while wearing a “1972” pin to symbolize the year before Roe v. Wade made abortion legal. “I left the clinic, looking back only to remember why I now advocate so passionately for life,” she said. She praised Trump for appointing conservative Supreme Court justices who would be sympathetic to pro-life ideals and for withdrawing federal funds from clinics that conduct abortion referrals. “Life is a core tenet of who we are as Americans,” Johnson said. “And this election is a choice between two radical, anti-life activists, and the most pro-life president we’ve ever had. That’s something that should compel you to action.” Johnson has come under fire for a number of controversial opinions. Vice reported Tuesday that she said in a video she thinks it is “smart” for police to be “on more high alert” when interacting with her biracial son than with her white sons because “statistically, my brown son is more likely to commit a violent offense over my white sons.” Recent tweets by Johnson also show she supports head-of-household voting rights, which would only allow one representative from a household to cast their vote rather than each adult citizen. “In a Godly household, the husband would get the final say,” she said. In a tweet ahead of her RNC appearance on Tuesday, Johnson accused abortion rights activists of being scared of her speech and “scrambling to try to find anything to detract people from my message.” —Jeanine Santucci Nicholas Sandmann, the student at the center of a media storm, urged voters Tuesday to support President Donald Trump because he refuses to allow news coverage “to create a narrative instead of reporting the facts.” “I believe we must join a president who will challenge the media to return to objective journalism,” Sandmann, 18, said before putting on a red “Make America Great Again” hat. “This is worth fighting for. This is worth voting for. This is what President Donald Trump stands for.” The news coverage that focused on Sandmann unfolded in January 2019, when the northern Kentucky teenager stared at Native American elder Nathan Phillips, who played a drum. A viral video of the moment played repeatedly on cable news and was reported in newspapers. Sandmann, then a student at Covington Catholic High School, was attending a March for Life. Phillips was attending an Indigenous Peoples March. Sandmann said unfair coverage of the event changed his life forever in one moment without reporters asking for his side of the story or investigating Phillips’ motives. “What I thought was a strange encounter, quickly developed into a major news story complete with video footage,” Sandmann said of his portrayal as a smirking boy in a red hat because of Trump’s opposition to abortion. “My life changed forever in that one moment. The full war machine of the mainstream media revved up into attack mode.” Sandmann sued CNN for $275 million by claiming the network defamed him, and the Washington Post. He reached undisclosed settlements in January. In March, Sandmann sued five more outlets, including Gannett, the parent company of USA TODAY. “I learned that what was happening to me had a name. It was called being cancelled. As in annulled. As in revoked. As in made void,” Sandmann said. “Many are being fired, humiliated or even threatened. Often, the media is a willing participant. But I would not be cancelled.” — Bart Jansen Cissie Graham Lynch, the daughter of evangelist Franklin Graham and granddaughter of legendary preacher Billy Graham, hailed President Donald Trump as a “fierce advocate in the White House” for people of faith who stands up for religious freedoms that were “under attack” during the Obama administration. “Our founders did not envision a quiet, hidden faith. They fought to ensure that voices of faith were always welcomed, not silenced. Not bullied,” she said. “But during the Obama-Biden administration, these freedoms were under attack.” The president is trying to shore up support among conservative Christians and white evangelicals who helped him secure his 2016 victory, but his approval rating among religious groups has slipped in recent months. A Pew Research Center survey last month found that 59% of white evangelicals say they “very strongly” approve of Trump, down eight points from April. But the survey also found that 82% would still vote for him if the election were held in July. Graham Lynch, whose father is scheduled to speak on Thursday, said Trump-appointed judges who “respect the First Amendment,” supported religious beliefs in court and “ensured religious ministries would not be forced to violate their beliefs.” She added there was “no room for people of faith” in the Biden administration, though the former vice president has frequently talked about how his Catholic faith has helped him survive the death of his first wife and their daughter in a 1972 car crash, as well as the death of his son in 2015. “Whether you’re a baker, a florist or a football coach, they will force the choice between being obedient to God or to Caesar,” she said. “Because the radical left’s god is government power.” Graham Lynch’s comments came hours after Jerushah Duford, another granddaughter of Billy Graham, penned a searing rebuke of Trump and her uncle Franklin Graham for his support of the president. Duford, who wrote in USA TODAY that her faith and church have become “a laughing stock,” called on evangelical Christian women to speak out against Trump’s actions. — Courtney Subramanian Breaking with the dire messaging of \"socialism\" and \"Loch Ness\" monsters that dominated the first night of the RNC, Republicans embraced a softer tone Tuesday -- at least in the early minutes -- ahead of first lady Melania Trump's address. \"He has followed through on his promises,\" asserted Maine lobsterman Jason Joyce. \"More than any president in my lifetime, he's acknowledged the importance of farmers and agriculture,\" said dairy farmer Chris Peterson. In the most notable example of the shift, Trump appeared himself briefly in a taped appearance from the White House and signed a pardon to Jon Ponder, founder of Hope For Prisoners, a Las Vegas-based organization that helps ex-prisoners re-enter society. The event drew scrutiny from Democrats, some of whom questioned the president's use of an official act at a political convention, but it nevertheless underscored more of a focus on the president's accomplishments rather than on what Republicans see as Biden's failures. \"Today, I’m filled with hope,\" Ponder said. \"I have been given a second chance.\" — John Fritze Jason Joyce, an eighth-generation lobsterman from Swan’s Island, Maine, said he didn't support President Donald Trump in 2016 because he expected the president \"to flip flop on his campaign promises.\" But Joyce strongly supports Trump’s reelection this year because the president listened to fishermen’s views and adopted them. In contrast, Joyce characterized the Obama administration and former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, as ignoring industry views. “As long as Trump is president, fishing families like mine will have a voice,” Joyce said. “But if Biden wins, he’ll be controlled by the environmental extremists who want to circumvent longstanding rules and impose radical changes that hurt our coastal communities.” Trump has promoted Maine lobster since a June 5 roundtable in Bangor. He reversed the Obama administration order that closed off 5,000 square miles of ocean to fishing for what is called the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument. “This action was deeply unfair to Maine lobstermen,” Trump said. The monument is about 130 miles southeast of Cape Cod – too far for Mainers to reach. And Obama grandfathered lobster and crab harvesting for seven years in the 2016 order, so those fisheries haven't been affected yet. But the decision still rankled fishermen. “Although Maine's lobstermen don't fish there, Obama's executive order offended us greatly. It circumvented the fisheries counsels’ input,” Joyce said. “President Trump reversed that decision, reinstating the rules that allow stakeholder input, and he supports a process that seeks and respects fishermen's views.” Lobster is a valuable seafood market, with 133 million pounds landed in 2017 worth nearly $600 million, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. Mainers landed more than 80% of the U.S. lobster catch that year. But trade wars have damaged the industry. The European Union agreed Friday to lift tariffs of 8% on U.S. lobster and 20% on lobster products, which had hurt trade compared to Canadian lobster that faced no tariffs. China also imposed a tariff on U.S. lobster in 2018 that now stands at least at 35%. Trump asked the Agriculture Department for monthly reports on the China tariff starting Aug. 15. Joyce said he strongly supported Trump's reelection. \"When he sees something isn't right, he’s fearless in fixing it,\" Joyce said. \"He listens to working people.\" — Bart Jansen Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican known for his anti-interventionist view of global affairs, praised Trump’s approach to “end war rather than start one,\" trying to portray a stark contrast between the president and Joe Biden when it comes to making the planet safer. \"I fear Biden will choose war again. He supported the war in Serbia, Syria, Libya. Joe Biden will continue to spill our blood and treasure. President Trump will bring our heroes home,\" said Paul, who has often joined the president in calling for the wind-down of U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq. \"If you hate war like I hate war…if you want us to quit sending $50 billion every year to Afghanistan to build their roads and bridges instead of building them here at home, you need to support President Trump for another term.\" Trump has touted his unconventional strategy on foreign policy, including efforts to build bridges with authoritarian figures such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea despot Kim Jong-Un. He’s also drawn bipartisan fire for trying to undermine the NATO alliance and for pulling troops out of Syria, a move that prompted the resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis. Paul, who did not appear at the RNC in 2016, had some unkind words for Trump four years ago when both were running for the White House. He called the billionaire businessman \"a delusional narcissist and an orange-faced windbag.\" Trump in turn criticized Paul's looks and called him \"a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain.\" — Ledyard King Norma Urrabazo from the International Church of Las Vegas opened Tuesday’s events with a prayer for “healing and comfort” for Jacob Blake, the Wisconsin man who was shot multiple times in the back by police officers Sunday while he was leaning into an SUV. “I’m going to invite you to join your faith with mine and let’s prayer in agreement,” Urrabazo said. “Lord, we come before you to ask for your spirit of peace to come over hurting communities in Wisconsin tonight.” In addition to prayer for Blake and his family, Urrabazo asked for protection for those who have “put their lives in harm’s way, to bring safety and security to our streets.” - Maureen Groppe Native Americans will make up a tiny slice of the electorate in November, but they could have an outsized influence on the election where it counts: Several battleground states. So it was no surprise the RNC opened its second night with Myron Lizer, vice president of the Navajo Nation – a territory that covers portions of Utah, New Mexico and Arizona. “Our people have never been invited into the American Dream,” said Lizer, who appeared with Trump at an event in Phoenix this year. “We’ve for years fought congressional battles with past congressmen and senators that were part of a broken system that ignored us. “That is, until President Trump took office,” he said. Lizer pointed specifically to billions of dollars in economic stimulus to help tribal communities address COVID-19. Trump has had a complicated relationship with Native Americans. He repeated use of the word “Pocahontas” to mock Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has been offensive to some. More recently, Trump slammed the decision to change the name of the Washington, D.C., NFL team, a word that is a slur used to describe Native Americans. According to the 2010 Census, 5.2 million people identified as American Indian and Alaska Native alone, or in combination with at least one other race. The vast majority vote Democratic, except in states where energy is a large focus of the regional economy, such as Alaska, North Dakota or Oklahoma.  Native Americans could also be a factor in Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. —John Fritze and Ledyard King President Donald Trump used a \"surprise appearance\" at Tuesday's Republican political convention to swear in five new U.S. citizens. While some analysts questioned Trump taking official actions at a political convention, the president supervised the swearing-in of five new U.S. citizens born in Bolivia, Lebanon, India, Ghana and Sudan. \"Congratulations – great going,\" Trump told the group in a video that the White House released hours before it played during the convention telecast. Noting that one of the new American citizens has a degree in psychology, Trump said: \"In other words, she can figure me out.\" While Trump used the ceremony to tout the virtues of legal immigration, Democrats said his crackdowns at the border are designed to keep out any person of color. Critics said Trump should not make such political use of the presidency at a political convention. Ben Rhodes, a foreign policy adviser to President Barack Obama, tweeted that the GOP meeting \"is infused with the illegal and unethical use of everything from the White House to the presidential pardon power.\" Before the immigration ceremony, Trump signed a federal pardon for Jon Ponder, founder of Hope For Prisoners, a Las Vegas-based organization that helps ex-prisoners re-enter society. \"Jon's life is a beautiful testament to the power of redemption,\" Trump said The state of Nevada had already granted clemency to Ponder, a convicted bank robber. Trump, who has made criminal justice reform a part of his agenda, praised Ponder's work with ex-prisoners, he did not mention voting rights. The president has opposed restoring voting rights for felons, and criticized governors who support the idea. In thanking Trump for his federal pardon, Ponder said \"we live in a nation of second chances.\" Richard Beasley, a retired FBI agent who once arrested Ponder but is now a friend, also appeared in the video, saying, \"I'm so proud of Jon with his life's turnaround, and for all the lives that he's helped to change.\" Critics said Trump's use of the presidency violates at least the spirit of the Hatch Act that forbids government employees engaging political activity. (Presidents, however, are exempt from the law.) \"The Hatch Act is a law designed to separate politics from public service,\" tweeted Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to President Barack Obama. \"Those lines are being erased tonight.\" In his latest break from political tradition, Trump is making appearances every night at the Republican convention. That will include his formal acceptance speech on Thursday night. Location: The White House. — David Jackson The first night of the Republican National Convention on Monday averaged 15.9 million television viewers – 29% less than viewership four years ago and 15% less than the first night of last week’s Democratic National Convention. It closely resembles the 27% nosedive in viewers for night 1 of the DNC convention, which averaged 18.7 million viewers. The opening night of the 2016 RNC convention in Cleveland, Ohio drew about 22.5 million viewers. The Nielsen figures, reported by Variety and the Los Angeles Times, combine viewership on the three main networks, ABC, CBS and NBC, and leading cable new networks CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. Fox News set the pace Monday leading with 7.1 million viewers followed by CNN’s 2 million viewers; ABC, nearly 2 million; NBC, 1.7 million; MSNBC, 1,6 million; and CBS, 1.5 million. Facing challenges of a global pandemic, both conventions ditched arenas and live audiences in favor of many recorded speeches and prepackaged videos. Democrats pieced together four nights of two-hour television shows while several Republican speakers shared the same stage at Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C. while President Donald Trump was featured in multiple videos shot in the White House. Although last week’s DNC viewership was down significantly, the campaign for Democratic nominee Joe Biden touted a record 10.2 million digital viewers, totaling 28.9 million viewers overall when combined with television viewership. — Joey Garrison On its second night, the Republican National Convention will get personal. The virtual lineup for Tuesday includes first lady Melania Trump and two of the president's children – Eric and Tiffany – along with a series of business people, advocates for Republican causes and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Melania Trump, rarely seen campaigning with the president, will be the big draw of the evening. The first lady will speak in prime time from the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, a project she supervised. President Donald Trump himself is also expected to show up during the online convention Tuesday. He plans to appear every night this week, leading up to his formal acceptance speech on Thursday night, also at the White House. – David Jackson The battle over who gets credit for the pre-COVID economic recovery has become a defining issue of the conventions as well as this year's presidential election. Not surprisingly, Democrats argued Tuesday that Joe Biden deserves much of the credit. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, speaking as part of the Biden campaign's RNC counter-programming, said it was the Obama-Biden administration that led the country out of the worst economic downturn in generations. Trump, she said, drove that progress into the ground through his trade wars and haphazard pandemic response. “Donald Trump has severely worsened our country’s economy,” Whitmer said. “Workers and families cannot afford four more of years of that.” Trump and other Republicans have argued that the recovery under Obama, who signed a major economic stimulus in 2009, was one of the slowest in the nation's history. While unemployment and market indicators were improving under Obama, they note those numbers took off at a faster rate once Trump was in the White House. The debate is important because both candidates are positioning themselves as best able to help the nation recover from the economic catastrophe caused by COVID-19. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., cited figures about how 1.5 million fewer jobs were created during the first three years of the Trump administration, compared to the final three years of the Obama administration. Booker also slammed Trump's tax cut bill as benefiting the rich while racking up enormous federal budget deficits. “We know people all across New Jersey are hurting and need some relief,” Booker said. “Working families know that the president isn’t looking out for them.” – Bart Jansen and John Fritze This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: RNC live updates: Melania Trump to speak on second night of convention",

    "[]  两市成交屡过万亿、散户狂奔入场、牛市呼声不绝于耳……你还在等什么？还不上车？点击立即开户，3分钟极速响应，直通“牛市”！ 原标题：美国又反悔了！计划出台新规：不再批准使用中兴等5家中企产品 来源：金十数据 继英国考虑加速降低华为在该国5G建设的参与度后，美国又“出新招”。根据外媒7月10日报道，美国政府计划在本周敲定新监管规则，将禁止美国政府从使用华为、中兴等5家中资企业产品的公司购买商品或服务。目前，5家中资企业都没有对此新规做出回应。 美国每年发出5000亿合同！美企如今面临“二选一”难题 报道称，这项规定将于8月13日生效，生效后会对那些向美国政府销售商品和服务的公司产生广泛影响，因为它们需要证明自己没有使用这5家公司的产品，即便这5家公司中不乏全球畅销品牌。且美国政府表示，该规定的实施和执行不会推迟，也很难获得豁免。 美国相关部门内部人士发言称，这项规定的主要目的不只是禁止政府使用这5家中资企业的产品，也是为了削弱这些企业的影响力。该内部人士总结称，这实际上是给那些向美国政府销售商品和服务的公司出了一道“二选一”的选择题：是跟美国政府做生意？还是跟中国公司做生意？而根据美国政府责任署（GAO）的数据，美国政府每年批准超5000亿美元的合同，如此庞大的“蛋糕”诱惑下，这些企业很有可能会选择前者。 值得一提的是，美国多次做出与华为相关的“不理智举动”，每每给出的理由都是“华为会对美国信息安全产生影响”。对此，华为已多次行动，用事实证明了美国这一理由是“不成立的”。 一方面，华为多年来一直致力于全球网络信息安全和用户隐私保护体系的构筑，2019年，华为向3GPP贡献了385条网络安全提案，在提案总数中占比超过24.6%，持续保持领先；另一方面，根据东方财富网7月9日消息，华为目前已率先完成中国5G推进组5G网络安全测试。可以说，华为的“安全”跟它的“5G”一样，值得信赖。 美国巨头向华为支付99亿专利费后，美国同意美企与华为合作！ 事实上，美国虽然想通过减少对华为零部件等5G设备的使用，以减低华为等中资企业在美国的影响力，但却仍得向华为支付5G技术专利费用。根据德国专利数据公司Iplytics发布的调查报告，截至目前为止，全球21500多个5G标准专利中，华为凭借3400多个专利注册数量位居世界第一，而美国的高通仅排名第6。截至目前，美国巨头电信运营商Verizon已向华为缴纳了约14亿美元（约合99亿元人民币）的专利授权费。 也许有人会提出疑问，美国或许有办法绕过华为专利技术建设5G？这大概率是行不通的。公开资料显示，华为掌握着大份额的“标准必要专利”，即为了世界电信行业的互通互联规定的基础性优秀专利。此前美国允许美企与华为合作，共同制定5G标准，也是基于华为手握大量专利，而美国无法绕开这些专利独立制定5G标准。 新华国际还曾评论称，美国对华为的各种“不理智举动”，实际上是在削减任何可能挑战美国技术领先优势的外国企业的实力，这种“扭曲的操作”最终只会“害人伤己”。 24小时滚动播报最新的财经资讯和视频，更多粉丝福利扫描二维码关注（sinafinance） 新浪财经意见反馈留言板 电话：400-052-0066 欢迎批评指正 新浪简介|广告服务|About Sina\n联系我们|招聘信息|通行证注册\n产品答疑|网站律师|SINA English Copyright © 1996-2020 SINA Corporation All Rights Reserved 新浪公司 版权所有",
    "[] 原标题：昨天夜里你熟睡时，48国学者警告美国！ 新冠疫情全球蔓延，在全世界本应团结共同抗疫之时，美国政府却意欲对华发动新冷战，这是对世界和平与安全的破坏，更是对人类共同利益和世界人权的蔑视。美国政客近来种种蛮横行径引起国际社会有识之士的普遍反感和强烈反对。7月25日，一场由48个国家学者和活动人士自发组织的题为“任何针对中国的新冷战都违背人类利益”全球在线公开会议在Zoom、Facebook与YouTube同步直播，并发布了名为“拒绝新冷战”的14个语种版本的共同声明。 此次活动集结了来自中国、美国、英国、印度、俄罗斯、加拿大、委内瑞拉和巴西等国的17位知名学者和意见领袖参与发言，包括美国粉色代码联合创始人美狄亚·本杰明（Medea Benjamin）、美国黑色议程报告阿贾穆·巴拉卡（Ajamu Baraka）与玛格丽特·金伯利（Margaret Kimberley）、美国知名记者评论家马克斯·布卢门撒尔（MaxBlumenthal）、中国人民大学重阳金融研究院执行院长王文、英国剑桥大学政治与国际关系高级研究员马丁·雅克（Martin Jacques）、印度Triconternal社会研究所执行董事维杰·普拉萨德（Vijay Prashad）、委内瑞拉外交部北美司副部长卡洛斯·罗恩（Carlos Ron）、俄罗斯汉学家《美国对中国：冠状病毒时代的冷战》作者尤里·塔夫洛夫克西（Yury Tavrovksy）、英国核裁军运动总干事凯特·哈德森（Kate Hudson）、巴西里约热内卢州立大学卡·德塞（Radhika Desai）、中国人民大学重阳金融研究院高级研究员罗思义（John Ross）、《终止于开始：苏维埃的奔溃》作者卡洛斯·马丁内斯（Carlos Martinez）、《中国的全球战略：走向一个多极世界》作者珍妮·克莱格（Jenny Clegg）、巴西里约热内卢州立大学副教授埃里亚斯·贾布尔（Elias Jabbour）与桥组（Qiao Collective）等，吸引全球超过50多个国家和地区的网友在线收看。 此次活动的前期预告所覆盖的人数超过500万，并在社交媒体上掀起了一股关于反对美国“新冷战”的讨论浪潮。其中仅卡洛斯·马丁内斯与小唐纳德·特朗普之间关于所谓“中国威胁论”的推特争论就吸引了全球数十万人的关注，仅单条转发量就超过14万。 作为唯一受邀发言的中国智库学者，中国人民大学重阳金融研究院执行院长王文认为，在未来三个月，在美国大选之前，是中美关系的高危期。特朗普政府为了赢得选举，什么事情都能做得出来。如果发生新冷战，那将是中美关系、是人类、也是世界的灾难。这是一场公开的政治阴谋。特朗普政府是这场灾难的源头。幸运的是，中国并没有像1947年苏联那样被“铁幕演说”激怒，不想以一场新冷战的方式寻求回击美国。 此次“拒绝新冷战”倡议的发起人之一、前英国伦敦商业与政策署署长、中国人民大学重阳金融研究院高级研究员罗思义（John Ross）提到，在过去的几十年里，美国是唯一一个公开发动大规模侵略战争的国家，给全世界带来了灾难。美国在联合国协议框架之外实施单方面制裁，扰乱了国际秩序。对中国发动战争的威胁将是一场难以想象的灾难。他强调，新冷战是一种对人类的威胁，全世界要反对“新冷战”，并在共同抗击疫情、反对战争、应对气候变化、反对任何形式的种族主义、共同促进经济和平发展等更加团结和努力。 《终止于开始：苏维埃的奔溃》作者卡洛斯·马丁内斯（Carlos Martinez）认为，中国崛起不应被视为威胁；中国在甩掉百年耻辱后所取得的成就——跻身技术先进国家行列，帮助数亿人摆脱贫困，值得赞扬。大国之间的和平共处、互利共赢不仅是可能的而且是必须的。 正如国务委员兼外交部长王毅7月9日“相互尊重、信任合作——把握中美关系的正确方向”中美智库媒体视频论坛上所说，当前中美关系正“面临1979年建交以来最严重的挑战”，他呼吁中美关系“能够重回正轨，真正实现长期健康稳定发展”。 此次“拒绝新冷战”的众多参会者一致表示，任何形式的新冷战都是完全违背人类的利益，呼吁美国摒弃冷战思维，支持中美在相互对话的基础上建立关系，并致力于人类团结。 为让全世界人民更好地了解此次活动发起的目的和意义，在会前就已公开了《任何针对中国的新冷战都违背人类利益》共同声明的多语种文本，包括中文、英语、法语和俄罗斯语等14种语言。来自世界各地的40多位政要、学者、社会意见领袖与和平组织共同签署该声明，并陆续得到包括退役的美国国防部前官员与欧洲左翼政党领袖等的联名签署。 以下为共同声明全文： 任何针对中国的新冷战都违背人类利益 我们注意到美国政府针对中国的言行越来越激进。这对世界和平构成威胁，是人类应对气候变化、控制疫情、反抗种族歧视等极为严重的共同问题，以及阻碍经济发展的障碍。 因此，我们认为，任何形式的新冷战都将完全违背人类的利益。与此相反，我们支持全球进行最大限度的合作，以应对我们作为一个物种所面临的巨大挑战。 因此，我们呼吁美国摒弃冷战思维，以及其正在采取的对世界和平构成重大威胁的其他动作，例如退出《中程核力量条约》、《巴黎气候变化协定》以及不断从联合国机构退群。美国也应停止施压其他国家支持其采取这种危险的立场。 我们支持中美在相互对话的基础上建立关系，并致力于人类团结。 责任编辑：吴金明 扫描左侧二维码下载，更多精彩内容随你看。（官方微博：新浪新闻） 违法和不良信息举报电话：4000520066\n举报邮箱：jubao@vip.sina.com Copyright © 1996-2020 SINA Corporation All Rights Reserved 新浪公司 版权所有",
    "[] 原标题：美媒：红杉资本、软银、泛大西洋投资也对收购TikTok交易感兴趣 【文/观察者网 张晨静】面对特朗普政府下达限期45天的“交易禁令”，短视频应用TikTok正积极寻找后路。继微软、推特相继加入收购、合并TikTok的谈判后，如今又传出包括红杉资本、软银、泛大西洋投资在内等多家投资字节跳动的外国企业也想加入洽谈，他们想“拯救”TikTok，令其在美业务能够继续运营。 据《华尔街日报》9日报道称，美国多家投资和科技公司正在探索收购TikTok美国业务的可能性，但他们都不得不克服与微软所面临同样高的障碍。 而就在该消息传出的后一日（10日），美财长在接受专访时再次对TikTok施压，声称特朗普已明确表示不允许TikTok以目前的形式继续经营。 字节跳动多个投资者想加入洽谈 上周，推特已经就与TikTok在美业务合并的可行性进行了初步谈判。报道称，目前尚不清楚推特是否会寻求达成交易。但该交易将面临重大挑战，且考虑到推特的规模，肯定需要其他投资者的帮助。 知情人士透露，有几家与推特或TikTok母公司字节跳动有关的投资公司，可能会在涉及推特或微软的交易中发挥作用。其中包括\n风投巨头红杉资本，其在中国的子公司曾在2014年首次投资字节跳动。 据一位了解这项投资的人士透露，如今红杉资本旗下的基金对字节跳动的持股比例略超过10%，而根据字节跳动股票最近的二次交易，红杉旗下基金所持股份的价值超过100亿美元。按这个价值计算，红杉资本的这笔投资将成为有史以来最成功的风投交易之一。 知情人士称，近几周红杉资本合伙人道格·里昂（Doug Leone）一直在推动与美国政府内部的接触，包括财长姆努钦和白宫高级顾问库什纳等，以制定一个能使TikTok继续在美运营的解决方案。 里昂是少数公开支持特朗普的硅谷领导人之一，他还为特朗普的连任竞选捐钱。\n里昂告诉他的助手，他会联系姆努钦和库什纳，看看如何能“拯救”TikTok。 字节跳动的投资者，还包括私募股权投资公司泛大西洋投资集团和日本投资巨头软银集团。 报道称，在软银的其他投资受挫之际，字节跳动已成为该集团的一个投资亮点。一名知情人士透露，\n软银自己也想加入TikTok的潜在竞购者行列，但作为一家外国公司，其被考虑的可能性不大。而泛大西洋投资集团首席执行官威廉·福特（William E． Ford）正在为TikTok游说。 另一位了解此次收购情况的人士称，一些字节跳动的投资者早些时候准备了一份TikTok的报价，其估值超300亿美元。目前尚不清楚这些投资者是否参与了对TikTok美国业务的潜在竞购。一位参与交易的人士表示，很多公司及其母公司都曾致电询问，但不清楚哪些是认真的，也不清楚哪一方被字节跳动认真对待。 微软已和字节跳动进行了数周的谈判，并被认为是最有可能与TikTok达成交易的公司。微软此前在声明中曾表示，可能会邀请其他美国投资者以少数股权的形式参与TikTok的交易。 不过报道称，软件巨头微软并不需要财务帮助，其公司市值超1.6万亿美元。截至6月份，该公司公布的现金和短期投资规模超过1360亿美元。而此前美媒记者曾透露，微软与TikTok的这笔交易估值最多达300亿美元。 目前微软拒绝就其可能希望其他投资者参与的原因发表评论。伯恩斯坦研究公司分析师马克·莫德勒（Mark Moerdler）表示，微软可能想让字节跳动现有的美国投资者参与到这起交易中来，但是让其他企业参与进来也可能会使原本已棘手的交易变得更加复杂。 一位了解谈判情况的人士表示，最初字节跳动及其投资者提议分拆TikTok，将股票权转给美国投资者，但保留现有的经济所有权。而白宫方面要求所有权结构也需作出改变，于是字节跳动及其投资者又提出了加入包括美国业务合作伙伴的可能性。白宫认为这或许行得通，为此字节跳动CEO张一鸣联系了微软，对可能的收购交易展开谈判。 美财长又施压：\nTikTok不能以目前形式继续下去 当地时间8月10日，美财长在接受美媒CNBC专访时再次对TikTok施压，声称TikTok大规模收集美国人的数据，不过美财政部拥有“补救这个情况所需的工具”。他还转述特朗普的话威胁称，总统“已非常明确地表示，不会让TikTok以目前这种形式继续下去。 姆努钦还表示，若有一个合适的美国买家，可让他们对未来的安全问题放心，这起交易将获批。否则总统已给出“最后期限”，TikTok将关门大吉。 在此之前，姆努钦就坚持认为，TikTok应出售给一家美国公司。他也曾多次与微软高层进行交谈，他相信自己就微软收购TikTok一事已在白宫内部取得了支持。 然而白宫高级贸易顾问纳瓦罗却不这么想。两周前，姆努钦就曾和纳瓦罗就美企收购TikTok一事大吵了一架，当时特朗普则在一边旁观。 针对特朗普政府下达限期45天的“交易禁令”，美媒早前援引知情人士的话称，TikTok最快将在今日（11日）就禁令起诉特朗普政府。起诉依据则是特朗普的行动可能违反了美国宪法，并且逾越了总统的权力。 责任编辑：鲍一凡 24小时滚动播报最新的财经资讯和视频，更多粉丝福利扫描二维码关注（sinafinance） 新浪财经意见反馈留言板 电话：400-052-0066 欢迎批评指正 新浪简介|广告服务|About Sina\n联系我们|招聘信息|通行证注册\n产品答疑|网站律师|SINA English Copyright © 1996-2020 SINA Corporation All Rights Reserved 新浪公司 版权所有",
    "[] 原标题：腾讯2020年中报：营收2229亿 线上业务增长迅速 每经记者 任芷霓    每经编辑 陈俊杰 8月12日，腾讯控股（00700，HK；昨日收盘价520.5港元）发布了2020年上半年业绩报告，报告显示，当期营收2229.48亿元，同比增长28%， 净利润572.32亿元，同比增长29%。其中第二季度营收1148.83亿元，同比增长29%，净利润301.53亿元，同比增长28%，延续了一季度增长趋势。 腾讯在通信及社交、网络游戏、数字内容、网络广告、金融科技、云与其他企业服务6大领域业绩增长亮眼，37家主流券商中有33家给出买入评级，国金证券对腾讯的目标价甚至达到694.66港元，国金证券认为，腾讯云服务在疫情期间能以60%~70%的速度快速增长，参考AWS云业务近年来的营业利润率30%，预计未来腾讯云服务成熟后，利润率也能达到30%。 不过，美国总统特朗普在8月6日晚颁布行政命令，称45天后（即9月20日起）禁止美国居民与微信海外版WeChat及其母公司腾讯进行任何生意往来，在45天后仍与腾讯开展业务的公司都将受到该命令的制裁。腾讯发言人表示，公司正在审阅行政命令的潜在后果以便更全面理解其对集团的影响。 云服务增长迅速 报告显示，上半年，腾讯业务增长亮点集中于通信及社交、网络游戏、数字内容、网络广告、金融科技、云与其他企业服务6大领域。其中，云与其他企业服务收入同比及环比双增长。 腾讯称，主要受互联网公司及公共服务领域客户的云服务用量提升带动，在新冠病毒疫情的影响下，线下项目的交付工作尚未在第二季度完全恢复，但腾讯与金融机构及公共服务领域客户签订了重大合同。在技术和基础建设方面，采用定制化的设备，建立和扩充超大型数据中心，有助于长远提升云服务的性能表现和优化成本。 从腾讯的业务上看，云服务是腾讯向产业互联网转型的一项重要抓手，无论是制造业领域的工业互联网，还是目前正火的电商直播，以及腾讯另一重点业务企业微信，都需要云的支持。 尤其在今年上半年疫情期间，腾讯推出云办公全家桶套餐，包括企业微信、腾讯会议、腾讯文档等近10款产品，与阿里钉钉、华为WeLink、字节跳动飞书以及美国上市公司Zoom竞争线上办公服务这一快速增长的市场。 腾讯在Q1财报中也披露，腾讯会议在2个月内日活过千万。国信证券认为，腾讯会议在一季度取得了突破性的成功，已经成为国内领先的视频会议应用，长期来看，在公司云服务投入不断加大下，云服务及企业服务在线下行业及公共部门的渗透率会加速普及。 除了疫情影响之外，云服务也因国家“新基建”政策大力提速。在“新基建”政策的号召下，腾讯宣布，未来5年将投入5000亿元，用于新基建的进一步布局。据介绍，腾讯计划在云计算、人工智能、区块链、服务器、大型数据中心、超算中心、物联网操作系统、5G网络、音视频通讯、网络安全、量子计算等领域重点投入。 腾讯新基建项目已逐步落地。7月3日，腾讯清远云计算数据中心正式开服，整个数据中心集群规划容纳服务器超过100万台。这是国家新基建战略背景下，腾讯云首个开服的超大规模数据中心，也是华南地区迄今为止最大的新基建项目。同时，腾讯云还在工业互联网平台发力，今年6、7月间，腾讯云与富士康、三一重工、华星光电等制造业龙头联手进行数字化转型。 对于云服务市场的发展，“强者恒强”是业内的共识。中信证券认为，全球IaaS市场竞争格局呈现出明显的马太效应，全球云计算市场竞争格局将维持在一个相对稳定的状态，亚马逊、微软、阿里、腾讯、华为等头部企业份额将持续提升。 华西证券也在研报中表示，公有云业务有明显的重资产属性，前期投入高，回报周期长，必须有持续的大资金投入才能保证行业领先。当前公有云行业洗牌正在加速，小玩家逐步退场，云计算市场客户加速流向头部玩家，未来依然会是强者恒强的趋势。 微信生态维持增长趋势 今年Q2，微信生态也维持了增长趋势，财报显示，微信月活跃账户数和日均消息数均取得同比增长。 细数微信近年来不断开发的新功能，企业微信、小程序、小商店、视频号，明显感觉微信生态商业化进程提速。 回想4年前，张小龙首次出席微信公开课PRO会场，他在演讲中表示，很多人比微信团队更着急微信的商业化，也不知道为什么。“但我们认为一个好的产品它的商业化和用户的价值、用户的体验并不是矛盾的”。 微信一直在践行这一价值观，尽可能让商业化存在于无形中。例如小程序应用，在无需下载安装的情况下将各个平台功能整合，张小龙认为小程序的核心理念即为“用完即走”，走了用户还会回来。 近年来，小程序不断升级服务维度，推出直播功能，上线快递小程序，提供“小店”标准化工具等，在疫情期间，健康码也承载于小程序功能上，上线25天后，累计亮码已经突破10亿次，覆盖人口超过8亿。 同时，微信生态中的企业微信、政务微信也正在渗透进各大企业和政府部门，根据官方数据，企业微信连接的微信用户高达2.5 亿，已经有数百万企业通过企业微信服务微信用户。目前看来，企业微信已经逐渐成为企业私域流量运营的主阵地，而企业微信与微信的互联互通让私域流量的运营有了更多玩法。 实际上，在微信诞生的很长一段时间内，借助朋友圈流量进行商业化的行为都极为“克制”，微信首次在朋友圈投放第一条广告是2015年，距离微信诞生已过了4年。 在广告业艰难前行的2020年，腾讯广告“逆势而行”，在Q2延续了高增长。报告显示，腾讯网络广告业务收入同比增长13%，实现185.52亿元，社交及其他广告收入增长27%，为152.62亿元。 腾讯认为，广告收入增长主要由于流量上升以及价格较高的视频广告占比上升，也因微信朋友圈库存和曝光量增长所带动。 在微信生态创新频出，商业化进程提速的当下，腾讯面临美国禁令的影响。美国总统特朗普在8月6日晚发布行政命令，在45天后禁止美国居民与微信海外版WeChat及其母公司腾讯进行任何生意往来，仍与腾讯开展业务的公司都将受到该命令的制裁。受此影响，腾讯股价在两天内跌去10%，市值损失660亿港元。而截至8月12日收盘，腾讯股价回升至520.5港元，当天上涨1.36%。 “掌”握科技鲜闻 （微信搜索techsina或扫描左侧二维码关注） 新浪科技 新浪科技为你带来最新鲜的科技资讯 苹果汇 苹果汇为你带来最新鲜的苹果产品新闻 新浪众测 新酷产品第一时间免费试玩 新浪探索 提供最新的科学家新闻，精彩的震撼图片 新浪科技意见反馈留言板 电话：400-052-0066 欢迎批评指正 新浪简介|广告服务|About Sina\n联系我们|招聘信息|通行证注册\n产品答疑|网站律师|SINA English Copyright © 1996-2020 SINA Corporation All Rights Reserved 新浪公司 版权所有",
    "[] 原标题：特朗普：别买固特异轮胎了！他们禁止员工戴印有我竞选口号的帽子 【环球网报道 记者 何卓谦】当地时间8月19日，特朗普呼吁人们抵制美国固特异轮胎橡胶公司，他指责该公司“玩弄政治”，禁止其员工戴印有支持他竞选口号“让美国再次伟大”（MAGA）的帽子，并威胁称，他将换掉自己总统座驾上的固特异轮胎。 当天早些时候，特朗普发推称“不要买固特异轮胎！它们禁止员工戴MAGA（特朗普竞选口号：让美国再次伟大）的帽子！”在当天的记者会上，特朗普进一步回答了关于这条推特的问题，他表示“在固特异那边的工人当中，我的民调很好，但是这家公司不让说‘警察的命也是命’（Blue Lives Mater），也不让戴MAGA帽子。”，“这说明他们固特异的上层有问题，真是太糟糕了。” 美国固特异轮胎橡胶公司始建于1898年，至今已有百余年的历史。它是世界最大的轮胎生产公司之一，总部位于美国俄亥俄州阿克隆市。特朗普的总统座驾使用的也是固特异轮胎。当被问及他是否会更换总统车的固特异轮胎时，特朗普给出了肯定的回答：“是的，我会根据进一步了解，换掉它们，拭目以待吧” 责任编辑：梁斌 SF055 24小时滚动播报最新的财经资讯和视频，更多粉丝福利扫描二维码关注（sinafinance） 新浪财经意见反馈留言板 电话：400-052-0066 欢迎批评指正 新浪简介|广告服务|About Sina\n联系我们|招聘信息|通行证注册\n产品答疑|网站律师|SINA English Copyright © 1996-2020 SINA Corporation All Rights Reserved 新浪公司 版权所有",

    "[] 原标题：美国前FBI局长科米：班农麻烦大了 来源：中国日报网 据俄罗斯卫星网报道，美国总统特朗普的前首席策略师史蒂夫·班农于20日被捕，被指控在修建美国与墨西哥边境墙的众筹项目中涉嫌欺诈与洗钱。 在班农被捕并被控从边境墙筹款中获利后，美国联邦调查局（FBI）前局长詹姆斯·科米23日称，班农陷入麻烦。“这再次提醒人们，这位总统身边的人都是什么样的人，”科米对哥伦比亚广播公司称，“在这一点上，他们几乎可以组建一个犯罪家庭。” 科米的话似乎应对了他2018年4月出版的书——《更高的忠诚》，在书中他将特朗普总统比作黑手党老大，特朗普于2017年5月解除了科米的职务。 科米表示：“这是一起非常严重的案件。纽约南区法院已经在一份非常详细的起诉书中陈述了这一点，他（班农）现在正处于一个麻烦的世界中。”科米称从无辜受害者身上获取大量钱财，这是非常严重的案件，“这会增加潜在的惩罚”。 科米表示班农陷入困境，从起诉书的详细阐述中就可以看出。“我不知道他和同案其他被告的下一步行动是什么，但这就是我所说的麻烦世界，”他说道。 班农拒不认罪，然而一旦罪名成立，他将面临20年监禁。被捕后，班农缴纳了500万美元的保释金随后离开法院。 责任编辑：张玉 扫描左侧二维码下载，更多精彩内容随你看。（官方微博：新浪新闻） 违法和不良信息举报电话：4000520066\n举报邮箱：jubao@vip.sina.com Copyright © 1996-2020 SINA Corporation All Rights Reserved 新浪公司 版权所有"
