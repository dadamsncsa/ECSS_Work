# ECSS_Work

This repo is setup to host code supporting text and image processing, data fusion, and knowledgebase representation. After creating this REPO I invited Darren and John to it.

I setup a new project board in GIT called XSEDE Research Project which will enable viewing of the high level schedule for the project that this REPO is supporting. It will also enable capture of notes which will enable asynchronous collaboration between me, John, and Darren. I will use KanBan style project tracking to support promotion of high level tasks through three phases: 'to do', 'in progress', and 'completed'. This will enable flexibility in defining tasks necessary to complete the schedule milestones. I still need to invite Darren and John to the project board.
